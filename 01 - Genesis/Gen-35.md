###### v1
God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and settle there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."
###### v2
So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your clothes;
###### v3
then come, let us go up to Bethel, that I may make an altar there to the God who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone."
###### v4
So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak that was near Shechem.
###### v5
As they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities all around them, so that no one pursued them.
###### v6
Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,
###### v7
and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because it was there that God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.
###### v8
And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So it was called Allon-bacuth.
###### v9
God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and he blessed him.
###### v10
God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; no longer shall you be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name." So he was called Israel.
###### v11
God said to him, "I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall spring from you.
###### v12
The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you."
###### v13
Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.
###### v14
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.
###### v15
So Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
###### v16
Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel was in childbirth, and she had hard labor.
###### v17
When she was in her hard labor, the midwife said to her, "Do not be afraid; for now you will have another son."
###### v18
As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
###### v19
So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),
###### v20
and Jacob set up a pillar at her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day.
###### v21
Israel journeyed on, and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
###### v22
While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
###### v23
The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
###### v24
The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
###### v25
The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid: Dan and Naphtali.
###### v26
The sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
###### v27
Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had resided as aliens.
###### v28
Now the days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.
###### v29
And Isaac breathed his last; he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
