###### v1
Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, "I have produced a man with the help of the LORD."
###### v2
Next she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.
###### v3
In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,
###### v4
and Abel for his part brought of the firstlings of his flock, their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,
###### v5
but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
###### v6
The LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?
###### v7
If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it."
###### v8
Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let us go out to the field." And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.
###### v9
Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" He said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"
###### v10
And the LORD said, "What have you done? Listen; your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground!
###### v11
And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
###### v12
When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."
###### v13
Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is greater than I can bear!
###### v14
Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me."
###### v15
Then the LORD said to him, "Not so! Whoever kills Cain will suffer a sevenfold vengeance." And the LORD put a mark on Cain, so that no one who came upon him would kill him.
###### v16
Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
###### v17
Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and named it Enoch after his son Enoch.
###### v18
To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech.
###### v19
Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
###### v20
Adah bore Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and have livestock.
###### v21
His brother's name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
###### v22
Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
###### v23
Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
###### v24
If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold."
###### v25
Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, for she said, "God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, because Cain killed him."
###### v26
To Seth also a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to invoke the name of the LORD.
