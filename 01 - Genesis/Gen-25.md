###### v21
Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD granted his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.
###### v22
The children struggled together within her; and she said, "If it is to be this way, why do I live?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.

And the LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger."
###### v24
When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb.
###### v25
The first came out red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau.
###### v26
Afterward his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.

When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.

Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright."
###### v32
Esau said, "I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?"

Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.
###### v34
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
