###### v1
After these things God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
###### v2
He said, "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall show you."
###### v3
So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and set out and went to the place in the distance that God had shown him.
###### v4
On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place far away.
###### v5
Then Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there; we will worship, and then we will come back to you."
###### v6
Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.
###### v7
Isaac said to his father Abraham, "Father!" And he said, "Here I am, my son." He said, "The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
###### v8
Abraham said, "God himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So the two of them walked on together.
###### v9
When they came to the place that God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order. He bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
###### v10
Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son.
###### v11
But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, "Abraham, Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
###### v12
He said, "Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."
###### v13
And Abraham looked up and saw a ram, caught in a thicket by its horns. Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.
###### v14
So Abraham called that place "The LORD will provide"; as it is said to this day, "On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided."
###### v15
The angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven,
###### v16
and said, "By myself I have sworn, says the LORD: Because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son,
###### v17
I will indeed bless you, and I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of their enemies,
###### v18
and by your offspring shall all the nations of the earth gain blessing for themselves, because you have obeyed my voice."
###### v19
So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham lived at Beer-sheba.
###### v20
Now after these things it was told Abraham, "Milcah also has borne children, to your brother Nahor:
###### v21
Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
###### v22
Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
###### v23
Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
###### v24
Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
