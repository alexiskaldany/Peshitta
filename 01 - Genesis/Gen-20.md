###### v1
From there Abraham journeyed toward the region of the Negeb, and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While residing in Gerar as an alien,
###### v2
Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." And King Abimelech of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
###### v3
But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, "You are about to die because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a married woman."
###### v4
Now Abimelech had not approached her; so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent people?
###### v5
Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' I did this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands."
###### v6
Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; furthermore it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.
###### v7
Now then, return the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all that are yours."
###### v8
So Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants and told them all these things; and the men were very much afraid.
###### v9
Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such great guilt on me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that ought not to be done."
###### v10
And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What were you thinking of, that you did this thing?"
###### v11
Abraham said, "I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.
###### v12
Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
###### v13
And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.'"
###### v14
Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him.
###### v15
Abimelech said, "My land is before you; settle where it pleases you."
###### v16
To Sarah he said, "Look, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; it is your exoneration before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated."
###### v17
Then Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.
###### v18
For the LORD had closed fast all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
