###### v1
The allotment of the Josephites went from the Jordan by Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, into the wilderness, going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel;
###### v2
then going from Bethel to Luz, it passes along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites;
###### v3
then it goes down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and it ends at the sea.
###### v4
The Josephites-- Manasseh and Ephraim-- received their inheritance.
###### v5
The territory of the Ephraimites by their families was as follows: the boundary of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon,
###### v6
and the boundary goes from there to the sea; on the north is Michmethath; then on the east the boundary makes a turn toward Taanath-shiloh, and passes along beyond it on the east to Janoah,
###### v7
then it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, and touches Jericho, ending at the Jordan.
###### v8
From Tappuah the boundary goes westward to the Wadi Kanah, and ends at the sea. Such is the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites by their families,
###### v9
together with the towns that were set apart for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites, all those towns with their villages.
###### v10
They did not, however, drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer: so the Canaanites have lived within Ephraim to this day but have been made to do forced labor.
