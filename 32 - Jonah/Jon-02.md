###### v1
Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish,
###### v2
saying, "I called to the LORD out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and you heard my voice.
###### v3
You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; all your waves and your billows passed over me.
###### v4
Then I said, 'I am driven away from your sight; how shall I look again upon your holy temple?'
###### v5
The waters closed in over me; the deep surrounded me; weeds were wrapped around my head
###### v6
at the roots of the mountains. I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever; yet you brought up my life from the Pit, O LORD my God.
###### v7
As my life was ebbing away, I remembered the LORD; and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple.
###### v8
Those who worship vain idols forsake their true loyalty.
###### v9
But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay. Deliverance belongs to the LORD!"
###### v10
Then the LORD spoke to the fish, and it spewed Jonah out upon the dry land.
