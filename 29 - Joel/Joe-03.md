###### v1
For then, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
###### v2
I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat, and I will enter into judgment with them there, on account of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations. They have divided my land,
###### v3
and cast lots for my people, and traded boys for prostitutes, and sold girls for wine, and drunk it down.
###### v4
What are you to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, I will turn your deeds back upon your own heads swiftly and speedily.
###### v5
For you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures into your temples.
###### v6
You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, removing them far from their own border.
###### v7
But now I will rouse them to leave the places to which you have sold them, and I will turn your deeds back upon your own heads.
###### v8
I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far away; for the LORD has spoken.
###### v9
Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare war, stir up the warriors. Let all the soldiers draw near, let them come up.
###### v10
Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weakling say, "I am a warrior."
###### v11
Come quickly, all you nations all around, gather yourselves there. Bring down your warriors, O LORD.
###### v12
Let the nations rouse themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there I will sit to judge all the neighboring nations.
###### v13
Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Go in, tread, for the wine press is full. The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.
###### v14
Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
###### v15
The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
###### v16
The LORD roars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shake. But the LORD is a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.
###### v17
So you shall know that I, the LORD your God, dwell in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through it.
###### v18
In that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, the hills shall flow with milk, and all the stream beds of Judah shall flow with water; a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD and water the Wadi Shittim.
###### v19
Egypt shall become a desolation and Edom a desolate wilderness, because of the violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they have shed innocent blood.
###### v20
But Judah shall be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem to all generations.
###### v21
I will avenge their blood, and I will not clear the guilty, for the LORD dwells in Zion.
