###### v1
Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; look, and see our disgrace!
###### v2
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to aliens.
###### v3
We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are like widows.
###### v4
We must pay for the water we drink; the wood we get must be bought.
###### v5
With a yoke on our necks we are hard driven; we are weary, we are given no rest.
###### v6
We have made a pact with Egypt and Assyria, to get enough bread.
###### v7
Our ancestors sinned; they are no more, and we bear their iniquities.
###### v8
Slaves rule over us; there is no one to deliver us from their hand.
###### v9
We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness.
###### v10
Our skin is black as an oven from the scorching heat of famine.
###### v11
Women are raped in Zion, virgins in the towns of Judah.
###### v12
Princes are hung up by their hands; no respect is shown to the elders.
###### v13
Young men are compelled to grind, and boys stagger under loads of wood.
###### v14
The old men have left the city gate, the young men their music.
###### v15
The joy of our hearts has ceased; our dancing has been turned to mourning.
###### v16
The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned!
###### v17
Because of this our hearts are sick, because of these things our eyes have grown dim:
###### v18
because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate; jackals prowl over it.
###### v19
But you, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures to all generations.
###### v20
Why have you forgotten us completely? Why have you forsaken us these many days?
###### v21
Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored; renew our days as of old--
###### v22
unless you have utterly rejected us, and are angry with us beyond measure.
