***

###### v1
I am one who has seen affliction under the rod of God's wrath;
###### v2
he has driven and brought me into darkness without any light;
###### v3
against me alone he turns his hand, again and again, all day long.
###### v4
He has made my flesh and my skin waste away, and broken my bones;
###### v5
he has besieged and enveloped me with bitterness and tribulation;
###### v6
he has made me sit in darkness like the dead of long ago.
###### v7
He has walled me about so that I cannot escape; he has put heavy chains on me;
###### v8
though I call and cry for help, he shuts out my prayer;
###### v9
he has blocked my ways with hewn stones, he has made my paths crooked.
###### v10
He is a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in hiding;
###### v11
he led me off my way and tore me to pieces; he has made me desolate;
###### v12
he bent his bow and set me as a mark for his arrow.
###### v13
He shot into my vitals the arrows of his quiver;
###### v14
I have become the laughingstock of all my people, the object of their taunt-songs all day long.
###### v15
He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood.
###### v16
He has made my teeth grind on gravel, and made me cower in ashes;
###### v17
my soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is;
###### v18
so I say, "Gone is my glory, and all that I had hoped for from the LORD."
###### v19
The thought of my affliction and my homelessness is wormwood and gall!
###### v20
My soul continually thinks of it and is bowed down within me.
###### v21
But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:
###### v22
The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases, his mercies never come to an end;
###### v23
they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
###### v24
"The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "therefore I will hope in him."
###### v25
The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.
###### v26
It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
###### v27
It is good for one to bear the yoke in youth,
###### v28
to sit alone in silence when the Lord has imposed it,
###### v29
to put one's mouth to the dust (there may yet be hope),
###### v30
to give one's cheek to the smiter, and be filled with insults.
###### v31
For the Lord will not reject forever.
###### v32
Although he causes grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love;
###### v33
for he does not willingly afflict or grieve anyone.
###### v34
When all the prisoners of the land are crushed under foot,
###### v35
when human rights are perverted in the presence of the Most High,
###### v36
when one's case is subverted-- does the Lord not see it?
###### v37
Who can command and have it done, if the Lord has not ordained it?
###### v38
Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and bad come?
###### v39
Why should any who draw breath complain about the punishment of their sins?
###### v40
Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the LORD.
###### v41
Let us lift up our hearts as well as our hands to God in heaven.
###### v42
We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven.
###### v43
You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us, killing without pity;
###### v44
you have wrapped yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through.
###### v45
You have made us filth and rubbish among the peoples.
###### v46
All our enemies have opened their mouths against us;
###### v47
panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction.
###### v48
My eyes flow with rivers of tears because of the destruction of my people.
###### v49
My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite,
###### v50
until the LORD from heaven looks down and sees.
###### v51
My eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the young women in my city.
###### v52
Those who were my enemies without cause have hunted me like a bird;
###### v53
they flung me alive into a pit and hurled stones on me;
###### v54
water closed over my head; I said, "I am lost."
###### v55
I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit;
###### v56
you heard my plea, "Do not close your ear to my cry for help, but give me relief!"
###### v57
You came near when I called on you; you said, "Do not fear!"
###### v58
You have taken up my cause, O Lord, you have redeemed my life.
###### v59
You have seen the wrong done to me, O LORD; judge my cause.
###### v60
You have seen all their malice, all their plots against me.
###### v61
You have heard their taunts, O LORD, all their plots against me.
###### v62
The whispers and murmurs of my assailants are against me all day long.
###### v63
Whether they sit or rise-- see, I am the object of their taunt-songs.
###### v64
Pay them back for their deeds, O LORD, according to the work of their hands!
###### v65
Give them anguish of heart; your curse be on them!
###### v66
Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the LORD's heavens.
