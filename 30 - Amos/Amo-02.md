###### v1
Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because he burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom.
###### v2
So I will send a fire on Moab, and it shall devour the strongholds of Kerioth, and Moab shall die amid uproar, amid shouting and the sound of the trumpet;
###### v3
I will cut off the ruler from its midst, and will kill all its officials with him, says the LORD.
###### v4
Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they have rejected the law of the LORD, and have not kept his statutes, but they have been led astray by the same lies after which their ancestors walked.
###### v5
So I will send a fire on Judah, and it shall devour the strongholds of Jerusalem.
###### v6
Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals--
###### v7
they who trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth, and push the afflicted out of the way; father and son go in to the same girl, so that my holy name is profaned;
###### v8
they lay themselves down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink wine bought with fines they imposed.
###### v9
Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of cedars, and who was as strong as oaks; I destroyed his fruit above, and his roots beneath.
###### v10
Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
###### v11
And I raised up some of your children to be prophets and some of your youths to be nazirites. Is it not indeed so, O people of Israel? says the LORD.
###### v12
But you made the nazirites drink wine, and commanded the prophets, saying, "You shall not prophesy."
###### v13
So, I will press you down in your place, just as a cart presses down when it is full of sheaves.
###### v14
Flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not retain their strength, nor shall the mighty save their lives;
###### v15
those who handle the bow shall not stand, and those who are swift of foot shall not save themselves, nor shall those who ride horses save their lives;
###### v16
and those who are stout of heart among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, says the LORD.
