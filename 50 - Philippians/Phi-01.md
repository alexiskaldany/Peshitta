###### v1
Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
###### v2
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
###### v3
I thank my God every time I remember you,
###### v4
constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you,
###### v5
because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now.
###### v6
I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Jesus Christ.
###### v7
It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because you hold me in your heart, for all of you share in God's grace with me, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.
###### v8
For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus.
###### v9
And this is my prayer, that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight
###### v10
to help you to determine what is best, so that in the day of Christ you may be pure and blameless,
###### v11
having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God.
###### v12
I want you to know, beloved, that what has happened to me has actually helped to spread the gospel,
###### v13
so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for Christ;
###### v14
and most of the brothers and sisters, having been made confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, dare to speak the word with greater boldness and without fear.
###### v15
Some proclaim Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill.
###### v16
These proclaim Christ out of love, knowing that I have been put here for the defense of the gospel;
###### v17
the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment.
###### v18
What does it matter? Just this, that Christ is proclaimed in every way, whether out of false motives or true; and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,
###### v19
for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance.
###### v20
It is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be put to shame in any way, but that by my speaking with all boldness, Christ will be exalted now as always in my body, whether by life or by death.
###### v21
For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.
###### v22
If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which I prefer.
###### v23
I am hard pressed between the two: my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better;
###### v24
but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.
###### v25
Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith,
###### v26
so that I may share abundantly in your boasting in Christ Jesus when I come to you again.
###### v27
Only, live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or am absent and hear about you, I will know that you are standing firm in one spirit, striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the gospel,
###### v28
and are in no way intimidated by your opponents. For them this is evidence of their destruction, but of your salvation. And this is God's doing.
###### v29
For he has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in Christ, but of suffering for him as well--
###### v30
since you are having the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.
