###### v1
If then there is any encouragement in Christ, any consolation from love, any sharing in the Spirit, any compassion and sympathy,
###### v2
make my joy complete: be of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.
###### v3
Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility regard others as better than yourselves.
###### v4
Let each of you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of others.
###### v5
Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,
###### v6
who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,
###### v7
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness. And being found in human form,
###### v8
he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death-- even death on a cross.
###### v9
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,
###### v10
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
###### v11
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
###### v12
Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed me, not only in my presence, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
###### v13
for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
###### v14
Do all things without murmuring and arguing,
###### v15
so that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine like stars in the world.
###### v16
It is by your holding fast to the word of life that I can boast on the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
###### v17
But even if I am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifice and the offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you--
###### v18
and in the same way you also must be glad and rejoice with me.
###### v19
I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may be cheered by news of you.
###### v20
I have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.
###### v21
All of them are seeking their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
###### v22
But Timothy's worth you know, how like a son with a father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.
###### v23
I hope therefore to send him as soon as I see how things go with me;
###### v24
and I trust in the Lord that I will also come soon.
###### v25
Still, I think it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus-- my brother and co-worker and fellow soldier, your messenger and minister to my need;
###### v26
for he has been longing for all of you, and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill.
###### v27
He was indeed so ill that he nearly died. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, so that I would not have one sorrow after another.
###### v28
I am the more eager to send him, therefore, in order that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious.
###### v29
Welcome him then in the Lord with all joy, and honor such people,
###### v30
because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for those services that you could not give me.
