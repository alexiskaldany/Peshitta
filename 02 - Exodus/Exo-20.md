###### v1
Then God spoke all these words:
###### v2
I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery;
###### v3
you shall have no other gods before me.
###### v4
You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
###### v5
You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me,
###### v6
but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.
###### v7
You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.
###### v8
Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy.
###### v9
Six days you shall labor and do all your work.
###### v10
But the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God; you shall not do any work-- you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns.
###### v11
For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and consecrated it.
###### v12
Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
###### v13
You shall not murder.
###### v14
You shall not commit adultery.
###### v15
You shall not steal.
###### v16
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
###### v17
You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
###### v18
When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and trembled and stood at a distance,
###### v19
and said to Moses, "You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die."
###### v20
Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid; for God has come only to test you and to put the fear of him upon you so that you do not sin."
###### v21
Then the people stood at a distance, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
###### v22
The LORD said to Moses: Thus you shall say to the Israelites: "You have seen for yourselves that I spoke with you from heaven.
###### v23
You shall not make gods of silver alongside me, nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold.
###### v24
You need make for me only an altar of earth and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your offerings of well-being, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you.
###### v25
But if you make for me an altar of stone, do not build it of hewn stones; for if you use a chisel upon it you profane it.
###### v26
You shall not go up by steps to my altar, so that your nakedness may not be exposed on it."
