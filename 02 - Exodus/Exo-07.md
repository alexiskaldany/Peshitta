###### v1
The LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.
###### v2
You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his land.
###### v3
But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and I will multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
###### v4
When Pharaoh does not listen to you, I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring my people the Israelites, company by company, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
###### v5
The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them."
###### v6
Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the LORD commanded them.
###### v7
Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
###### v8
The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
###### v9
"When Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a wonder,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, and it will become a snake.'"
###### v10
So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the LORD had commanded; Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake.
###### v11
Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same by their secret arts.
###### v12
Each one threw down his staff, and they became snakes; but Aaron's staff swallowed up theirs.
###### v13
Still Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
###### v14
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go.
###### v15
Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water; stand by at the river bank to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that was turned into a snake.
###### v16
Say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you to say, "Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness." But until now you have not listened.'
###### v17
Thus says the LORD, "By this you shall know that I am the LORD." See, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall be turned to blood.
###### v18
The fish in the river shall die, the river itself shall stink, and the Egyptians shall be unable to drink water from the Nile.'"
###### v19
The LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt-- over its rivers, its canals, and its ponds, and all its pools of water-- so that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout the whole land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"
###### v20
Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh and of his officials he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the river, and all the water in the river was turned into blood,
###### v21
and the fish in the river died. The river stank so that the Egyptians could not drink its water, and there was blood throughout the whole land of Egypt.
###### v22
But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts; so Pharaoh's heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them; as the LORD had said.
###### v23
Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart.
###### v24
And all the Egyptians had to dig along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the river.
###### v25
Seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.
