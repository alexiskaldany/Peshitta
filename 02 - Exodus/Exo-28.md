You shall make sacred vestments for the glorious adornment of your brother Aaron.
###### v3
And you shall speak to all who have ability, whom I have endowed with skill, that they make Aaron's vestments to consecrate him for my priesthood.

These are the vestments that they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a checkered tunic, a turban, and a sash. When they make these sacred vestments for your brother Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests,
###### v5
they shall use gold, blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine linen.
###### v6
They shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen, skillfully worked.

The decorated band on it shall be of the same workmanship and materials, of gold, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen.

You shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel,
###### v10
six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the remaining six on the other stone, in the order of their birth.
###### v11
As a gem-cutter engraves signets, so you shall engrave the two stones with the names of the sons of Israel; you shall mount them in settings of gold filigree.
###### v12
You shall set the two stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, as stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD on his two shoulders for remembrance.
###### v13
You shall make settings of gold filigree,
###### v14
and two chains of pure gold, twisted like cords; and you shall attach the corded chains to the settings.
###### v15
You shall make a breastpiece of judgment, in skilled work; you shall make it in the style of the ephod; of gold, of blue and purple and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen you shall make it.
###### v16
It shall be square and doubled, a span in length and a span in width.
###### v17
You shall set in it four rows of stones. A row of carnelian, chrysolite, and emerald shall be the first row;

and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
###### v20
and the fourth row a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they shall be set in gold filigree.
###### v21
There shall be twelve stones with names corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel; they shall be like signets, each engraved with its name, for the twelve tribes.
###### v22
You shall make for the breastpiece chains of pure gold, twisted like cords;
###### v23
and you shall make for the breastpiece two rings of gold, and put the two rings on the two edges of the breastpiece.
###### v24
You shall put the two cords of gold in the two rings at the edges of the breastpiece;
###### v25
the two ends of the two cords you shall attach to the two settings, and so attach it in front to the shoulder-pieces of the ephod.
###### v26
You shall make two rings of gold, and put them at the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inside edge next to the ephod.
###### v27
You shall make two rings of gold, and attach them in front to the lower part of the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod, at its joining above the decorated band of the ephod.
###### v28
The breastpiece shall be bound by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it may lie on the decorated band of the ephod, and so that the breastpiece shall not come loose from the ephod.
###### v29
So Aaron shall bear the names of the sons of Israel in the breastpiece of judgment on his heart when he goes into the holy place, for a continual remembrance before the LORD.
###### v30
In the breastpiece of judgment you shall put the Urim and the Thummim, and they shall be on Aaron's heart when he goes in before the LORD; thus Aaron shall bear the judgment of the Israelites on his heart before the LORD continually.
###### v31
You shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.
###### v32
It shall have an opening for the head in the middle of it, with a woven binding around the opening, like the opening in a coat of mail, so that it may not be torn.
###### v33
On its lower hem you shall make pomegranates of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, all around the lower hem, with bells of gold between them all around--
###### v34
a golden bell and a pomegranate alternating all around the lower hem of the robe.
###### v35
Aaron shall wear it when he ministers, and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the holy place before the LORD, and when he comes out, so that he may not die.
###### v36
You shall make a rosette of pure gold, and engrave on it, like the engraving of a signet, "Holy to the LORD."

You shall fasten it on the turban with a blue cord; it shall be on the front of the turban.
###### v38
It shall be on Aaron's forehead, and Aaron shall take on himself any guilt incurred in the holy offering that the Israelites consecrate as their sacred donations; it shall always be on his forehead, in order that they may find favor before the LORD.

You shall make the checkered tunic of fine linen, and you shall make a turban of fine linen, and you shall make a sash embroidered with needlework.

You shall make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh; they shall reach from the hips to the thighs;
###### v43
Aaron and his sons shall wear them when they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister in the holy place; or they will bring guilt on themselves and die. This shall be a perpetual ordinance for him and for his descendants after him.
