###### v1
Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful one to whom the LORD has given skill and understanding to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary shall work in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded.
###### v2
Moses then called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful one to whom the LORD had given skill, everyone whose heart was stirred to come to do the work;
###### v3
and they received from Moses all the freewill offerings that the Israelites had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning,
###### v4
so that all the artisans who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task being performed,
###### v5
and said to Moses, "The people are bringing much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do."
###### v6
So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp: "No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing;
###### v7
for what they had already brought was more than enough to do all the work.
###### v8
All those with skill among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains; they were made of fine twisted linen, and blue, purple, and crimson yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked into them.
###### v9
The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains were of the same size.
###### v10
He joined five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he joined to one another.
###### v11
He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set; likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set;
###### v12
he made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one another.
###### v13
And he made fifty clasps of gold, and joined the curtains one to the other with clasps; so the tabernacle was one whole.
###### v14
He also made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains.
###### v15
The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains were of the same size.
###### v16
He joined five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
###### v17
He made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain.
###### v18
He made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together so that it might be one whole.
###### v19
And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams' skins and an outer covering of fine leather.
###### v20
Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood.
###### v21
Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the width of each frame.
###### v22
Each frame had two pegs for fitting together; he did this for all the frames of the tabernacle.
###### v23
The frames for the tabernacle he made in this way: twenty frames for the south side;
###### v24
and he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames, two bases under the first frame for its two pegs, and two bases under the next frame for its two pegs.
###### v25
For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty frames
###### v26
and their forty bases of silver, two bases under the first frame and two bases under the next frame.
###### v27
For the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six frames.
###### v28
He made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear.
###### v29
They were separate beneath, but joined at the top, at the first ring; he made two of them in this way, for the two corners.
###### v30
There were eight frames with their bases of silver: sixteen bases, under every frame two bases.
###### v31
He made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle,
###### v32
and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward.
###### v33
He made the middle bar to pass through from end to end halfway up the frames.
###### v34
And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made rings of gold for them to hold the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
###### v35
He made the curtain of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine twisted linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.
###### v36
For it he made four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four bases of silver.
###### v37
He also made a screen for the entrance to the tent, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine twisted linen, embroidered with needlework;
###### v38
and its five pillars with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals and their bases with gold, but their five bases were of bronze.
