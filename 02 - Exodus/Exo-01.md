###### v1
These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:
###### v2
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
###### v3
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
###### v4
Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
###### v5
The total number of people born to Jacob was seventy. Joseph was already in Egypt.
###### v6
Then Joseph died, and all his brothers, and that whole generation.
###### v7
But the Israelites were fruitful and prolific; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.
###### v8
Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
###### v9
He said to his people, "Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and more powerful than we.
###### v10
Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase and, in the event of war, join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land."
###### v11
Therefore they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labor. They built supply cities, Pithom and Rameses, for Pharaoh.
###### v12
But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread, so that the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.
###### v13
The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Israelites,
###### v14
and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and brick and in every kind of field labor. They were ruthless in all the tasks that they imposed on them.
###### v15
The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,
###### v16
"When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birthstool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, she shall live."
###### v17
But the midwives feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but they let the boys live.
###### v18
So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this, and allowed the boys to live?"
###### v19
The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them."
###### v20
So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very strong.
###### v21
And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.
###### v22
Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, "Every boy that is born to the Hebrews you shall throw into the Nile, but you shall let every girl live."
