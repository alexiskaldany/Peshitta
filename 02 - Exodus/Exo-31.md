###### v1
The LORD spoke to Moses:
###### v2
See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
###### v3
and I have filled him with divine spirit, with ability, intelligence, and knowledge in every kind of craft,
###### v4
to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze,
###### v5
in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, in every kind of craft.
###### v6
Moreover, I have appointed with him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and I have given skill to all the skillful, so that they may make all that I have commanded you:
###### v7
the tent of meeting, and the ark of the covenant, and the mercy seat that is on it, and all the furnishings of the tent,
###### v8
the table and its utensils, and the pure lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense,
###### v9
and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand,
###### v10
and the finely worked vestments, the holy vestments for the priest Aaron and the vestments of his sons, for their service as priests,
###### v11
and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense for the holy place. They shall do just as I have commanded you.
###### v12
The LORD said to Moses:
###### v13
You yourself are to speak to the Israelites: "You shall keep my sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, given in order that you may know that I, the LORD, sanctify you.
###### v14
You shall keep the sabbath, because it is holy for you; everyone who profanes it shall be put to death; whoever does any work on it shall be cut off from among the people.
###### v15
Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD; whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall be put to death.
###### v16
Therefore the Israelites shall keep the sabbath, observing the sabbath throughout their generations, as a perpetual covenant.
###### v17
It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed."
###### v18
When God finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.
