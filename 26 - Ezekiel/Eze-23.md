###### v1
The word of the LORD came to me:
###### v2
Mortal, there were two women, the daughters of one mother;
###### v3
they played the whore in Egypt; they played the whore in their youth; their breasts were caressed there, and their virgin bosoms were fondled.
###### v4
Oholah was the name of the elder and Oholibah the name of her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
###### v5
Oholah played the whore while she was mine; she lusted after her lovers the Assyrians, warriors
###### v6
clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, mounted horsemen.
###### v7
She bestowed her favors upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone for whom she lusted.
###### v8
She did not give up her whorings that she had practiced since Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and fondled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her.
###### v9
Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.
###### v10
These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her daughters; and they killed her with the sword. Judgment was executed upon her, and she became a byword among women.
###### v11
Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt than she in her lusting and in her whorings, which were worse than those of her sister.
###### v12
She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed in full armor, mounted horsemen, all of them handsome young men.
###### v13
And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way.
###### v14
But she carried her whorings further; she saw male figures carved on the wall, images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,
###### v15
with belts around their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers-- a picture of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.
###### v16
When she saw them she lusted after them, and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
###### v17
And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their lust; and after she defiled herself with them, she turned from them in disgust.
###### v18
When she carried on her whorings so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned from her sister.
###### v19
Yet she increased her whorings, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt
###### v20
and lusted after her paramours there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose emission was like that of stallions.
###### v21
Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your bosom and caressed your young breasts.
###### v22
Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: I will rouse against you your lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side:
###### v23
the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and warriors, all of them riding on horses.
###### v24
They shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples; they shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet, and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their ordinances.
###### v25
I will direct my indignation against you, in order that they may deal with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors shall fall by the sword. They shall seize your sons and your daughters, and your survivors shall be devoured by fire.
###### v26
They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your fine jewels.
###### v27
So I will put an end to your lewdness and your whoring brought from the land of Egypt; you shall not long for them, or remember Egypt any more.
###### v28
For thus says the Lord GOD: I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust;
###### v29
and they shall deal with you in hatred, and take away all the fruit of your labor, and leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your whorings shall be exposed. Your lewdness and your whorings
###### v30
have brought this upon you, because you played the whore with the nations, and polluted yourself with their idols.
###### v31
You have gone the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.
###### v32
Thus says the Lord GOD: You shall drink your sister's cup, deep and wide; you shall be scorned and derided, it holds so much.
###### v33
You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. A cup of horror and desolation is the cup of your sister Samaria;
###### v34
you shall drink it and drain it out, and gnaw its sherds, and tear out your breasts; for I have spoken, says the Lord GOD.
###### v35
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, therefore bear the consequences of your lewdness and whorings.
###### v36
The LORD said to me: Mortal, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominable deeds.
###### v37
For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands; with their idols they have committed adultery; and they have even offered up to them for food the children whom they had borne to me.
###### v38
Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my sabbaths.
###### v39
For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. This is what they did in my house.
###### v40
They even sent for men to come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments;
###### v41
you sat on a stately couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed my incense and my oil.
###### v42
The sound of a raucous multitude was around her, with many of the rabble brought in drunken from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on the arms of the women, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
###### v43
Then I said, Ah, she is worn out with adulteries, but they carry on their sexual acts with her.
###### v44
For they have gone in to her, as one goes in to a whore. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, wanton women.
###### v45
But righteous judges shall declare them guilty of adultery and of bloodshed; because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.
###### v46
For thus says the Lord GOD: Bring up an assembly against them, and make them an object of terror and of plunder.
###### v47
The assembly shall stone them and with their swords they shall cut them down; they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses.
###### v48
Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, so that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done.
###### v49
They shall repay you for your lewdness, and you shall bear the penalty for your sinful idolatry; and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
