[[Ezekiel]] | [[Eze-02|Ezekiel - Chapter 2 ]]
***

###### v1
In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
###### v2
On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin),
###### v3
the word of the LORD came to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was on him there.
###### v4
As I looked, a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud with brightness around it and fire flashing forth continually, and in the middle of the fire, something like gleaming amber.
###### v5
In the middle of it was something like four living creatures. This was their appearance: they were of human form.
###### v6
Each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.
###### v7
Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze.
###### v8
Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:
###### v9
their wings touched one another; each of them moved straight ahead, without turning as they moved.
###### v10
As for the appearance of their faces: the four had the face of a human being, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle;
###### v11
such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies.
###### v12
Each moved straight ahead; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went.
###### v13
In the middle of the living creatures there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving to and fro among the living creatures; the fire was bright, and lightning issued from the fire.
###### v14
The living creatures darted to and fro, like a flash of lightning.
###### v15
As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.
###### v16
As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl; and the four had the same form, their construction being something like a wheel within a wheel.
###### v17
When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veering as they moved.
###### v18
Their rims were tall and awesome, for the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
###### v19
When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.
###### v20
Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
###### v21
When they moved, the others moved; when they stopped, the others stopped; and when they rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
###### v22
Over the heads of the living creatures there was something like a dome, shining like crystal, spread out above their heads.
###### v23
Under the dome their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each of the creatures had two wings covering its body.
###### v24
When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army; when they stopped, they let down their wings.
###### v25
And there came a voice from above the dome over their heads; when they stopped, they let down their wings.
###### v26
And above the dome over their heads there was something like a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was something that seemed like a human form.
###### v27
Upward from what appeared like the loins I saw something like gleaming amber, something that looked like fire enclosed all around; and downward from what looked like the loins I saw something that looked like fire, and there was a splendor all around.
###### v28
Like the bow in a cloud on a rainy day, such was the appearance of the splendor all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of someone speaking.
