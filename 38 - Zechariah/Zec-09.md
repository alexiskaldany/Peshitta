###### v1
An Oracle. The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach and will rest upon Damascus. For to the LORD belongs the capital of Aram, as do all the tribes of Israel;
###### v2
Hamath also, which borders on it, Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.
###### v3
Tyre has built itself a rampart, and heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets.
###### v4
But now, the Lord will strip it of its possessions and hurl its wealth into the sea, and it shall be devoured by fire.
###### v5
Ashkelon shall see it and be afraid; Gaza too, and shall writhe in anguish; Ekron also, because its hopes are withered. The king shall perish from Gaza; Ashkelon shall be uninhabited;
###### v6
a mongrel people shall settle in Ashdod, and I will make an end of the pride of Philistia.
###### v7
I will take away its blood from its mouth, and its abominations from between its teeth; it too shall be a remnant for our God; it shall be like a clan in Judah, and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites.
###### v8
Then I will encamp at my house as a guard, so that no one shall march to and fro; no oppressor shall again overrun them, for now I have seen with my own eyes.
###### v9
Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
###### v10
He will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the war-horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall command peace to the nations; his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
###### v11
As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.
###### v12
Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double.
###### v13
For I have bent Judah as my bow; I have made Ephraim its arrow. I will arouse your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and wield you like a warrior's sword.
###### v14
Then the LORD will appear over them, and his arrow go forth like lightning; the Lord GOD will sound the trumpet and march forth in the whirlwinds of the south.
###### v15
The LORD of hosts will protect them, and they shall devour and tread down the slingers; they shall drink their blood like wine, and be full like a bowl, drenched like the corners of the altar.
###### v16
On that day the LORD their God will save them for they are the flock of his people; for like the jewels of a crown they shall shine on his land.
###### v17
For what goodness and beauty are his! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the young women.
