###### v1
I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.
###### v2
Then I asked, "Where are you going?" He answered me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length."
###### v3
Then the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him,
###### v4
and said to him, "Run, say to that young man: Jerusalem shall be inhabited like villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and animals in it.
###### v5
For I will be a wall of fire all around it, says the LORD, and I will be the glory within it."
###### v6
Up, up! Flee from the land of the north, says the LORD; for I have spread you abroad like the four winds of heaven, says the LORD.
###### v7
Up! Escape to Zion, you that live with daughter Babylon.
###### v8
For thus said the LORD of hosts (after his glory sent me) regarding the nations that plundered you: Truly, one who touches you touches the apple of my eye.
###### v9
See now, I am going to raise my hand against them, and they shall become plunder for their own slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.
###### v10
Sing and rejoice, O daughter Zion! For lo, I will come and dwell in your midst, says the LORD.
###### v11
Many nations shall join themselves to the LORD on that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in your midst. And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
###### v12
The LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.
###### v13
Be silent, all people, before the LORD; for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.
