###### v1
The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place; he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,
###### v2
who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw.
###### v3
==Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of the prophecy, and blessed are those who hear and who keep what is written in it; for the time is near.==
*Read out loud more*
###### v4
John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne,
###### v5
and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood,
###### v6
and made us to be a kingdom, priests serving his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
###### v7
Look! He is coming with the clouds; every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and on his account all the tribes of the earth will wail. So it is to be. Amen.
###### v8
"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.
###### v9
I, John, your brother who share with you in Jesus the persecution and the kingdom and the patient endurance, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
###### v10
I was in the spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet
###### v11
saying, "Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
###### v12
Then I turned to see whose voice it was that spoke to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands,
###### v13
and in the midst of the lampstands I saw one like the Son of Man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash across his chest.
###### v14
His head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; his eyes were like a flame of fire,
###### v15
his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters.
###### v16
In his right hand he held seven stars, and from his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining with full force.
###### v17
When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he placed his right hand on me, saying, "Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last,
###### v18
and the living one. I was dead, and see, I am alive forever and ever; and I have the keys of Death and of Hades.
###### v19
Now write what you have seen, what is, and what is to take place after this.
###### v20
As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
