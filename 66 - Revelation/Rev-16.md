###### v1
Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, "Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God."
###### v2
So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth, and a foul and painful sore came on those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped its image.
###### v3
The second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing in the sea died.
###### v4
The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.
###### v5
And I heard the angel of the waters say, "You are just, O Holy One, who are and were, for you have judged these things;
###### v6
because they shed the blood of saints and prophets, you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!"
###### v7
And I heard the altar respond, "Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, your judgments are true and just!"
###### v8
The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch them with fire;
###### v9
they were scorched by the fierce heat, but they cursed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues, and they did not repent and give him glory.
###### v10
The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness; people gnawed their tongues in agony,
###### v11
and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores, and they did not repent of their deeds.
###### v12
The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings from the east.
###### v13
And I saw three foul spirits like frogs coming from the mouth of the dragon, from the mouth of the beast, and from the mouth of the false prophet.
###### v14
These are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty.
###### v15
("See, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and is clothed, not going about naked and exposed to shame.")
###### v16
And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Harmagedon.
###### v17
The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
###### v18
And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and a violent earthquake, such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth, so violent was that earthquake.
###### v19
The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. God remembered great Babylon and gave her the wine-cup of the fury of his wrath.
###### v20
And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found;
###### v21
and huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, dropped from heaven on people, until they cursed God for the plague of the hail, so fearful was that plague.
