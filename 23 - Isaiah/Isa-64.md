###### v1
O that you would tear open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would quake at your presence--
###### v2
as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil-- to make your name known to your adversaries, so that the nations might tremble at your presence!
###### v3
When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
###### v4
From ages past no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who works for those who wait for him.
###### v5
You meet those who gladly do right, those who remember you in your ways. But you were angry, and we sinned; because you hid yourself we transgressed.
###### v6
We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
###### v7
There is no one who calls on your name, or attempts to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.
###### v8
Yet, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.
###### v9
Do not be exceedingly angry, O LORD, and do not remember iniquity forever. Now consider, we are all your people.
###### v10
Your holy cities have become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
###### v11
Our holy and beautiful house, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned by fire, and all our pleasant places have become ruins.
###### v12
After all this, will you restrain yourself, O LORD? Will you keep silent, and punish us so severely?
