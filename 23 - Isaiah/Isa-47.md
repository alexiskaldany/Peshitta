###### v1
Come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter Babylon! Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter Chaldea! For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.
###### v2
Take the millstones and grind meal, remove your veil, strip off your robe, uncover your legs, pass through the rivers.
###### v3
Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will spare no one.
###### v4
Our Redeemer-- the LORD of hosts is his name-- is the Holy One of Israel.
###### v5
Sit in silence, and go into darkness, daughter Chaldea! For you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.
###### v6
I was angry with my people, I profaned my heritage; I gave them into your hand, you showed them no mercy; on the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy.
###### v7
You said, "I shall be mistress forever," so that you did not lay these things to heart or remember their end.
###### v8
Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me; I shall not sit as a widow or know the loss of children"--
###### v9
both these things shall come upon you in a moment, in one day: the loss of children and widowhood shall come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the great power of your enchantments.
###### v10
You felt secure in your wickedness; you said, "No one sees me." Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me."
###### v11
But evil shall come upon you, which you cannot charm away; disaster shall fall upon you, which you will not be able to ward off; and ruin shall come on you suddenly, of which you know nothing.
###### v12
Stand fast in your enchantments and your many sorceries, with which you have labored from your youth; perhaps you may be able to succeed, perhaps you may inspire terror.
###### v13
You are wearied with your many consultations; let those who study the heavens stand up and save you, those who gaze at the stars, and at each new moon predict what shall befall you.
###### v14
See, they are like stubble, the fire consumes them; they cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. No coal for warming oneself is this, no fire to sit before!
###### v15
Such to you are those with whom you have labored, who have trafficked with you from your youth; they all wander about in their own paths; there is no one to save you.
