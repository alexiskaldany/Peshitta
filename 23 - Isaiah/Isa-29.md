###### v1
Ah, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the festivals run their round.
###### v2
Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be moaning and lamentation, and Jerusalem shall be to me like an Ariel.
###### v3
And like David I will encamp against you; I will besiege you with towers and raise siegeworks against you.
###### v4
Then deep from the earth you shall speak, from low in the dust your words shall come; your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.
###### v5
But the multitude of your foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of tyrants like flying chaff. And in an instant, suddenly,
###### v6
you will be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
###### v7
And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, all that fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, shall be like a dream, a vision of the night.
###### v8
Just as when a hungry person dreams of eating and wakes up still hungry, or a thirsty person dreams of drinking and wakes up faint, still thirsty, so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.
###### v9
Stupefy yourselves and be in a stupor, blind yourselves and be blind! Be drunk, but not from wine; stagger, but not from strong drink!
###### v10
For the LORD has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep; he has closed your eyes, you prophets, and covered your heads, you seers.
###### v11
The vision of all this has become for you like the words of a sealed document. If it is given to those who can read, with the command, "Read this," they say, "We cannot, for it is sealed."
###### v12
And if it is given to those who cannot read, saying, "Read this," they say, "We cannot read."
###### v13
The Lord said: Because these people draw near with their mouths and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their worship of me is a human commandment learned by rote;
###### v14
so I will again do amazing things with this people, shocking and amazing. The wisdom of their wise shall perish, and the discernment of the discerning shall be hidden.
###### v15
Ha! You who hide a plan too deep for the LORD, whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, "Who sees us? Who knows us?"
###### v16
You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay? Shall the thing made say of its maker, "He did not make me"; or the thing formed say of the one who formed it, "He has no understanding"?
###### v17
Shall not Lebanon in a very little while become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be regarded as a forest?
###### v18
On that day the deaf shall hear the words of a scroll, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.
###### v19
The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD, and the neediest people shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.
###### v20
For the tyrant shall be no more, and the scoffer shall cease to be; all those alert to do evil shall be cut off--
###### v21
those who cause a person to lose a lawsuit, who set a trap for the arbiter in the gate, and without grounds deny justice to the one in the right.
###### v22
Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: No longer shall Jacob be ashamed, no longer shall his face grow pale.
###### v23
For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will sanctify my name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
###### v24
And those who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will accept instruction.
