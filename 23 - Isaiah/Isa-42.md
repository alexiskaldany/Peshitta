###### v1
Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.
###### v2
He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street;
###### v3
a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice.
###### v4
He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his teaching.
###### v5
Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it, who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:
###### v6
I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you; I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations,
###### v7
to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.
###### v8
I am the LORD, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.
###### v9
See, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth, I tell you of them.
###### v10
Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the end of the earth! Let the sea roar and all that fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants.
###### v11
Let the desert and its towns lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy, let them shout from the tops of the mountains.
###### v12
Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the coastlands.
###### v13
The LORD goes forth like a soldier, like a warrior he stirs up his fury; he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against his foes.
###### v14
For a long time I have held my peace, I have kept still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in labor, I will gasp and pant.
###### v15
I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbage; I will turn the rivers into islands, and dry up the pools.
###### v16
I will lead the blind by a road they do not know, by paths they have not known I will guide them. I will turn the darkness before them into light, the rough places into level ground. These are the things I will do, and I will not forsake them.
###### v17
They shall be turned back and utterly put to shame-- those who trust in carved images, who say to cast images, "You are our gods."
###### v18
Listen, you that are deaf; and you that are blind, look up and see!
###### v19
Who is blind but my servant, or deaf like my messenger whom I send? Who is blind like my dedicated one, or blind like the servant of the LORD?
###### v20
He sees many things, but does not observe them; his ears are open, but he does not hear.
###### v21
The LORD was pleased, for the sake of his righteousness, to magnify his teaching and make it glorious.
###### v22
But this is a people robbed and plundered, all of them are trapped in holes and hidden in prisons; they have become a prey with no one to rescue, a spoil with no one to say, "Restore!"
###### v23
Who among you will give heed to this, who will attend and listen for the time to come?
###### v24
Who gave up Jacob to the spoiler, and Israel to the robbers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned, in whose ways they would not walk, and whose law they would not obey?
###### v25
So he poured upon him the heat of his anger and the fury of war; it set him on fire all around, but he did not understand; it burned him, but he did not take it to heart.
