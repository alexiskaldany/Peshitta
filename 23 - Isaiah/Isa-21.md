###### v1
The oracle concerning the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the Negeb sweep on, it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.
###### v2
A stern vision is told to me; the betrayer betrays, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam, lay siege, O Media; all the sighing she has caused I bring to an end.
###### v3
Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman in labor; I am bowed down so that I cannot hear, I am dismayed so that I cannot see.
###### v4
My mind reels, horror has appalled me; the twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling.
###### v5
They prepare the table, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink. Rise up, commanders, oil the shield!
###### v6
For thus the Lord said to me: "Go, post a lookout, let him announce what he sees.
###### v7
When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, let him listen diligently, very diligently."
###### v8
Then the watcher called out: "Upon a watchtower I stand, O Lord, continually by day, and at my post I am stationed throughout the night.
###### v9
Look, there they come, riders, horsemen in pairs!" Then he responded, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the images of her gods lie shattered on the ground."
###### v10
O my threshed and winnowed one, what I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I announce to you.
###### v11
The oracle concerning Dumah. One is calling to me from Seir, "Sentinel, what of the night? Sentinel, what of the night?"
###### v12
The sentinel says: "Morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire; come back again."
###### v13
The oracle concerning the desert plain. In the scrub of the desert plain you will lodge, O caravans of Dedanites.
###### v14
Bring water to the thirsty, meet the fugitive with bread, O inhabitants of the land of Tema.
###### v15
For they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the stress of battle.
###### v16
For thus the Lord said to me: Within a year, according to the years of a hired worker, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end;
###### v17
and the remaining bows of Kedar's warriors will be few; for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.
