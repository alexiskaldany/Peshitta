###### v1
Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and who came forth from the loins of Judah; who swear by the name of the LORD, and invoke the God of Israel, but not in truth or right.
###### v2
For they call themselves after the holy city, and lean on the God of Israel; the LORD of hosts is his name.
###### v3
The former things I declared long ago, they went out from my mouth and I made them known; then suddenly I did them and they came to pass.
###### v4
Because I know that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead brass,
###### v5
I declared them to you from long ago, before they came to pass I announced them to you, so that you would not say, "My idol did them, my carved image and my cast image commanded them."
###### v6
You have heard; now see all this; and will you not declare it? From this time forward I make you hear new things, hidden things that you have not known.
###### v7
They are created now, not long ago; before today you have never heard of them, so that you could not say, "I already knew them."
###### v8
You have never heard, you have never known, from of old your ear has not been opened. For I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and that from birth you were called a rebel.
###### v9
For my name's sake I defer my anger, for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, so that I may not cut you off.
###### v10
See, I have refined you, but not like silver; I have tested you in the furnace of adversity.
###### v11
For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for why should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.
###### v12
Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called: I am He; I am the first, and I am the last.
###### v13
My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they stand at attention.
###### v14
Assemble, all of you, and hear! Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he shall perform his purpose on Babylon, and his arm shall be against the Chaldeans.
###### v15
I, even I, have spoken and called him, I have brought him, and he will prosper in his way.
###### v16
Draw near to me, hear this! From the beginning I have not spoken in secret, from the time it came to be I have been there. And now the Lord GOD has sent me and his spirit.
###### v17
Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the LORD your God, who teaches you for your own good, who leads you in the way you should go.
###### v18
O that you had paid attention to my commandments! Then your prosperity would have been like a river, and your success like the waves of the sea;
###### v19
your offspring would have been like the sand, and your descendants like its grains; their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before me.
###### v20
Go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea, declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it, send it forth to the end of the earth; say, "The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!"
###### v21
They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split open the rock and the water gushed out.
###### v22
"There is no peace," says the LORD, "for the wicked."
