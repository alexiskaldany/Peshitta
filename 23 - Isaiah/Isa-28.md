###### v1
Ah, the proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim, and the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of those bloated with rich food, of those overcome with wine!
###### v2
See, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong; like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, like a storm of mighty, overflowing waters; with his hand he will hurl them down to the earth.
###### v3
Trampled under foot will be the proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim.
###### v4
And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of those bloated with rich food, will be like a first-ripe fig before the summer; whoever sees it, eats it up as soon as it comes to hand.
###### v5
In that day the LORD of hosts will be a garland of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people;
###### v6
and a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
###### v7
These also reel with wine and stagger with strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are confused with wine, they stagger with strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in giving judgment.
###### v8
All tables are covered with filthy vomit; no place is clean.
###### v9
"Whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from milk, those taken from the breast?
###### v10
For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little."
###### v11
Truly, with stammering lip and with alien tongue he will speak to this people,
###### v12
to whom he has said, "This is rest; give rest to the weary; and this is repose"; yet they would not hear.
###### v13
Therefore the word of the LORD will be to them, "Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little;" in order that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
###### v14
Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.
###### v15
Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol we have an agreement; when the overwhelming scourge passes through it will not come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and in falsehood we have taken shelter";
###### v16
therefore thus says the Lord GOD, See, I am laying in Zion a foundation stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation: "One who trusts will not panic."
###### v17
And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and waters will overwhelm the shelter.
###### v18
Then your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; when the overwhelming scourge passes through you will be beaten down by it.
###### v19
As often as it passes through, it will take you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.
###### v20
For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on it, and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in it.
###### v21
For the LORD will rise up as on Mount Perazim, he will rage as in the valley of Gibeon; to do his deed-- strange is his deed! and to work his work-- alien is his work!
###### v22
Now therefore do not scoff, or your bonds will be made stronger; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord GOD of hosts upon the whole land.
###### v23
Listen, and hear my voice; Pay attention, and hear my speech.
###### v24
Do those who plow for sowing plow continually? Do they continually open and harrow their ground?
###### v25
When they have leveled its surface, do they not scatter dill, sow cummin, and plant wheat in rows and barley in its proper place, and spelt as the border?
###### v26
For they are well instructed; their God teaches them.
###### v27
Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is a cart wheel rolled over cummin; but dill is beaten out with a stick, and cummin with a rod.
###### v28
Grain is crushed for bread, but one does not thresh it forever; one drives the cart wheel and horses over it, but does not pulverize it.
###### v29
This also comes from the LORD of hosts; he is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
