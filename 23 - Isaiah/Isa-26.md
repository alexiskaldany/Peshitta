###### v1
On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; he sets up victory like walls and bulwarks.
###### v2
Open the gates, so that the righteous nation that keeps faith may enter in.
###### v3
Those of steadfast mind you keep in peace-- in peace because they trust in you.
###### v4
Trust in the LORD forever, for in the LORD GOD you have an everlasting rock.
###### v5
For he has brought low the inhabitants of the height; the lofty city he lays low. He lays it low to the ground, casts it to the dust.
###### v6
The foot tramples it, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.
###### v7
The way of the righteous is level; O Just One, you make smooth the path of the righteous.
###### v8
In the path of your judgments, O LORD, we wait for you; your name and your renown are the soul's desire.
###### v9
My soul yearns for you in the night, my spirit within me earnestly seeks you. For when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
###### v10
If favor is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness they deal perversely and do not see the majesty of the LORD.
###### v11
O LORD, your hand is lifted up, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people, and be ashamed. Let the fire for your adversaries consume them.
###### v12
O LORD, you will ordain peace for us, for indeed, all that we have done, you have done for us.
###### v13
O LORD our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but we acknowledge your name alone.
###### v14
The dead do not live; shades do not rise-- because you have punished and destroyed them, and wiped out all memory of them.
###### v15
But you have increased the nation, O LORD, you have increased the nation; you are glorified; you have enlarged all the borders of the land.
###### v16
O LORD, in distress they sought you, they poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.
###### v17
Like a woman with child, who writhes and cries out in her pangs when she is near her time, so were we because of you, O LORD;
###### v18
we were with child, we writhed, but we gave birth only to wind. We have won no victories on earth, and no one is born to inhabit the world.
###### v19
Your dead shall live, their corpses shall rise. O dwellers in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a radiant dew, and the earth will give birth to those long dead.
###### v20
Come, my people, enter your chambers, and shut your doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until the wrath is past.
###### v21
For the LORD comes out from his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth will disclose the blood shed on it, and will no longer cover its slain.
