###### v1
See, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.
###### v2
Each will be like a hiding place from the wind, a covert from the tempest, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a great rock in a weary land.
###### v3
Then the eyes of those who have sight will not be closed, and the ears of those who have hearing will listen.
###### v4
The minds of the rash will have good judgment, and the tongues of stammerers will speak readily and distinctly.
###### v5
A fool will no longer be called noble, nor a villain said to be honorable.
###### v6
For fools speak folly, and their minds plot iniquity: to practice ungodliness, to utter error concerning the LORD, to leave the craving of the hungry unsatisfied, and to deprive the thirsty of drink.
###### v7
The villainies of villains are evil; they devise wicked devices to ruin the poor with lying words, even when the plea of the needy is right.
###### v8
But those who are noble plan noble things, and by noble things they stand.
###### v9
Rise up, you women who are at ease, hear my voice; you complacent daughters, listen to my speech.
###### v10
In little more than a year you will shudder, you complacent ones; for the vintage will fail, the fruit harvest will not come.
###### v11
Tremble, you women who are at ease, shudder, you complacent ones; strip, and make yourselves bare, and put sackcloth on your loins.
###### v12
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,
###### v13
for the soil of my people growing up in thorns and briers; yes, for all the joyous houses in the jubilant city.
###### v14
For the palace will be forsaken, the populous city deserted; the hill and the watchtower will become dens forever, the joy of wild asses, a pasture for flocks;
###### v15
until a spirit from on high is poured out on us, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is deemed a forest.
###### v16
Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.
###### v17
The effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever.
###### v18
My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.
###### v19
The forest will disappear completely, and the city will be utterly laid low.
###### v20
Happy will you be who sow beside every stream, who let the ox and the donkey range freely.
