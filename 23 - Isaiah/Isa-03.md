###### v1
For now the Sovereign, the LORD of hosts, is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and staff-- all support of bread, and all support of water--
###### v2
warrior and soldier, judge and prophet, diviner and elder,
###### v3
captain of fifty and dignitary, counselor and skillful magician and expert enchanter.
###### v4
And I will make boys their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
###### v5
The people will be oppressed, everyone by another and everyone by a neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder, and the base to the honorable.
###### v6
Someone will even seize a relative, a member of the clan, saying, "You have a cloak; you shall be our leader, and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule."
###### v7
But the other will cry out on that day, saying, "I will not be a healer; in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; you shall not make me leader of the people."
###### v8
For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen, because their speech and their deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.
###### v9
The look on their faces bears witness against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom, they do not hide it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves.
###### v10
Tell the innocent how fortunate they are, for they shall eat the fruit of their labors.
###### v11
Woe to the guilty! How unfortunate they are, for what their hands have done shall be done to them.
###### v12
My people-- children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, your leaders mislead you, and confuse the course of your paths.
###### v13
The LORD rises to argue his case; he stands to judge the peoples.
###### v14
The LORD enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: It is you who have devoured the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
###### v15
What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor? says the Lord GOD of hosts.
###### v16
The LORD said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks, glancing wantonly with their eyes, mincing along as they go, tinkling with their feet;
###### v17
the Lord will afflict with scabs the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will lay bare their secret parts.
###### v18
In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets, the headbands, and the crescents;
###### v19
the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarfs;
###### v20
the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets;
###### v21
the signet rings and nose rings;
###### v22
the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags;
###### v23
the garments of gauze, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.
###### v24
Instead of perfume there will be a stench; and instead of a sash, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a binding of sackcloth; instead of beauty, shame.
###### v25
Your men shall fall by the sword and your warriors in battle.
###### v26
And her gates shall lament and mourn; ravaged, she shall sit upon the ground.
