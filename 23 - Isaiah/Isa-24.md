###### v1
Now the LORD is about to lay waste the earth and make it desolate, and he will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants.
###### v2
And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the slave, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.
###### v3
The earth shall be utterly laid waste and utterly despoiled; for the LORD has spoken this word.
###### v4
The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers; the heavens languish together with the earth.
###### v5
The earth lies polluted under its inhabitants; for they have transgressed laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.
###### v6
Therefore a curse devours the earth, and its inhabitants suffer for their guilt; therefore the inhabitants of the earth dwindled, and few people are left.
###### v7
The wine dries up, the vine languishes, all the merry-hearted sigh.
###### v8
The mirth of the timbrels is stilled, the noise of the jubilant has ceased, the mirth of the lyre is stilled.
###### v9
No longer do they drink wine with singing; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
###### v10
The city of chaos is broken down, every house is shut up so that no one can enter.
###### v11
There is an outcry in the streets for lack of wine; all joy has reached its eventide; the gladness of the earth is banished.
###### v12
Desolation is left in the city, the gates are battered into ruins.
###### v13
For thus it shall be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, as at the gleaning when the grape harvest is ended.
###### v14
They lift up their voices, they sing for joy; they shout from the west over the majesty of the LORD.
###### v15
Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD; in the coastlands of the sea glorify the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
###### v16
From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise, of glory to the Righteous One. But I say, I pine away, I pine away. Woe is me! For the treacherous deal treacherously, the treacherous deal very treacherously.
###### v17
Terror, and the pit, and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!
###### v18
Whoever flees at the sound of the terror shall fall into the pit; and whoever climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For the windows of heaven are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.
###### v19
The earth is utterly broken, the earth is torn asunder, the earth is violently shaken.
###### v20
The earth staggers like a drunkard, it sways like a hut; its transgression lies heavy upon it, and it falls, and will not rise again.
###### v21
On that day the LORD will punish the host of heaven in heaven, and on earth the kings of the earth.
###### v22
They will be gathered together like prisoners in a pit; they will be shut up in a prison, and after many days they will be punished.
###### v23
Then the moon will be abashed, and the sun ashamed; for the LORD of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his elders he will manifest his glory.
