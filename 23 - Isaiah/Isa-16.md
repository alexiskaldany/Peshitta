###### v1
Send lambs to the ruler of the land, from Sela, by way of the desert, to the mount of daughter Zion.
###### v2
Like fluttering birds, like scattered nestlings, so are the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon.
###### v3
"Give counsel, grant justice; make your shade like night at the height of noon; hide the outcasts, do not betray the fugitive;
###### v4
let the outcasts of Moab settle among you; be a refuge to them from the destroyer." When the oppressor is no more, and destruction has ceased, and marauders have vanished from the land,
###### v5
then a throne shall be established in steadfast love in the tent of David, and on it shall sit in faithfulness a ruler who seeks justice and is swift to do what is right.
###### v6
We have heard of the pride of Moab-- how proud he is!-- of his arrogance, his pride, and his insolence; his boasts are false.
###### v7
Therefore let Moab wail, let everyone wail for Moab. Mourn, utterly stricken, for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth.
###### v8
For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vines of Sibmah, whose clusters once made drunk the lords of the nations, reached to Jazer and strayed to the desert; their shoots once spread abroad and crossed over the sea.
###### v9
Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vines of Sibmah; I drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for the shout over your fruit harvest and your grain harvest has ceased.
###### v10
Joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful field; and in the vineyards no songs are sung, no shouts are raised; no treader treads out wine in the presses; the vintage-shout is hushed.
###### v11
Therefore my heart throbs like a harp for Moab, and my very soul for Kir-heres.
###### v12
When Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself upon the high place, when he comes to his sanctuary to pray, he will not prevail.
###### v13
This was the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab in the past.
###### v14
But now the LORD says, In three years, like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt, in spite of all its great multitude; and those who survive will be very few and feeble.
