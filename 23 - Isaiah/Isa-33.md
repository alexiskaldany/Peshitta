###### v1
Ah, you destroyer, who yourself have not been destroyed; you treacherous one, with whom no one has dealt treacherously! When you have ceased to destroy, you will be destroyed; and when you have stopped dealing treacherously, you will be dealt with treacherously.
###### v2
O LORD, be gracious to us; we wait for you. Be our arm every morning, our salvation in the time of trouble.
###### v3
At the sound of tumult, peoples fled; before your majesty, nations scattered.
###### v4
Spoil was gathered as the caterpillar gathers; as locusts leap, they leaped upon it.
###### v5
The LORD is exalted, he dwells on high; he filled Zion with justice and righteousness;
###### v6
he will be the stability of your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is Zion's treasure.
###### v7
Listen! the valiant cry in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
###### v8
The highways are deserted, travelers have quit the road. The treaty is broken, its oaths are despised, its obligation is disregarded.
###### v9
The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is confounded and withers away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.
###### v10
"Now I will arise," says the LORD, "now I will lift myself up; now I will be exalted.
###### v11
You conceive chaff, you bring forth stubble; your breath is a fire that will consume you.
###### v12
And the peoples will be as if burned to lime, like thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire."
###### v13
Hear, you who are far away, what I have done; and you who are near, acknowledge my might.
###### v14
The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless: "Who among us can live with the devouring fire? Who among us can live with everlasting flames?"
###### v15
Those who walk righteously and speak uprightly, who despise the gain of oppression, who wave away a bribe instead of accepting it, who stop their ears from hearing of bloodshed and shut their eyes from looking on evil,
###### v16
they will live on the heights; their refuge will be the fortresses of rocks; their food will be supplied, their water assured.
###### v17
Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; they will behold a land that stretches far away.
###### v18
Your mind will muse on the terror: "Where is the one who counted? Where is the one who weighed the tribute? Where is the one who counted the towers?"
###### v19
No longer will you see the insolent people, the people of an obscure speech that you cannot comprehend, stammering in a language that you cannot understand.
###### v20
Look on Zion, the city of our appointed festivals! Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, an immovable tent, whose stakes will never be pulled up, and none of whose ropes will be broken.
###### v21
But there the LORD in majesty will be for us a place of broad rivers and streams, where no galley with oars can go, nor stately ship can pass.
###### v22
For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our ruler, the LORD is our king; he will save us.
###### v23
Your rigging hangs loose; it cannot hold the mast firm in its place, or keep the sail spread out. Then prey and spoil in abundance will be divided; even the lame will fall to plundering.
###### v24
And no inhabitant will say, "I am sick"; the people who live there will be forgiven their iniquity.
