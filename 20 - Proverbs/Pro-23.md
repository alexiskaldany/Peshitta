###### v1
When you sit down to eat with a ruler, observe carefully what is before you,
###### v2
and put a knife to your throat if you have a big appetite.
###### v3
Do not desire the ruler's delicacies, for they are deceptive food.
###### v4
Do not wear yourself out to get rich; be wise enough to desist.
###### v5
When your eyes light upon it, it is gone; for suddenly it takes wings to itself, flying like an eagle toward heaven.
###### v6
Do not eat the bread of the stingy; do not desire their delicacies;
###### v7
for like a hair in the throat, so are they. "Eat and drink!" they say to you; but they do not mean it.
###### v8
You will vomit up the little you have eaten, and you will waste your pleasant words.
###### v9
Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, who will only despise the wisdom of your words.
###### v10
Do not remove an ancient landmark or encroach on the fields of orphans,
###### v11
for their redeemer is strong; he will plead their cause against you.
###### v12
Apply your mind to instruction and your ear to words of knowledge.
###### v13
Do not withhold discipline from your children; if you beat them with a rod, they will not die.

Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always continue in the fear of the LORD.
###### v18
Surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.
###### v19
Hear, my child, and be wise, and direct your mind in the way.
###### v20
Do not be among winebibbers, or among gluttonous eaters of meat;
###### v21
for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them with rags.
###### v22
Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old.
###### v23
Buy truth, and do not sell it; buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding.
###### v24
The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who begets a wise son will be glad in him.
###### v25
Let your father and mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice.
###### v26
My child, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.
###### v27
For a prostitute is a deep pit; an adulteress is a narrow well.
###### v28
She lies in wait like a robber and increases the number of the faithless.
###### v29
Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?
###### v30
Those who linger late over wine, those who keep trying mixed wines.
###### v31
Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.
###### v32
At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.
###### v33
Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind utter perverse things.
###### v34
You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, like one who lies on the top of a mast.
###### v35
"They struck me," you will say, "but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I will seek another drink."
