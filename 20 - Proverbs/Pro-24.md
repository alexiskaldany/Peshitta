###### v1
Do not envy the wicked, nor desire to be with them;
###### v2
for their minds devise violence, and their lips talk of mischief.
###### v3
By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established;
###### v4
by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
###### v5
Wise warriors are mightier than strong ones, and those who have knowledge than those who have strength;
###### v6
for by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory.
###### v7
Wisdom is too high for fools; in the gate they do not open their mouths.
###### v8
Whoever plans to do evil will be called a mischief-maker.
###### v9
The devising of folly is sin, and the scoffer is an abomination to all.
###### v10
If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength being small;
###### v11
if you hold back from rescuing those taken away to death, those who go staggering to the slaughter;
###### v12
if you say, "Look, we did not know this"-- does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it? And will he not repay all according to their deeds?
###### v13
My child, eat honey, for it is good, and the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste.
###### v14
Know that wisdom is such to your soul; if you find it, you will find a future, and your hope will not be cut off.
###### v15
Do not lie in wait like an outlaw against the home of the righteous; do no violence to the place where the righteous live;
###### v16
for though they fall seven times, they will rise again; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
###### v17
Do not rejoice when your enemies fall, and do not let your heart be glad when they stumble,
###### v18
or else the LORD will see it and be displeased, and turn away his anger from them.
###### v19
Do not fret because of evildoers. Do not envy the wicked;
###### v20
for the evil have no future; the lamp of the wicked will go out.
###### v21
My child, fear the LORD and the king, and do not disobey either of them;
###### v22
for disaster comes from them suddenly, and who knows the ruin that both can bring?
###### v23
These also are sayings of the wise: Partiality in judging is not good.
###### v24
Whoever says to the wicked, "You are innocent," will be cursed by peoples, abhorred by nations;
###### v25
but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight, and a good blessing will come upon them.
###### v26
One who gives an honest answer gives a kiss on the lips.
###### v27
Prepare your work outside, get everything ready for you in the field; and after that build your house.
###### v28
Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips.
###### v29
Do not say, "I will do to others as they have done to me; I will pay them back for what they have done."
###### v30
I passed by the field of one who was lazy, by the vineyard of a stupid person;
###### v31
and see, it was all overgrown with thorns; the ground was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.
###### v32
Then I saw and considered it; I looked and received instruction.
###### v33
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
###### v34
and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want, like an armed warrior.
