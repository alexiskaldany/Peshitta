###### v1
Does not wisdom call, and does not understanding raise her voice?
###### v2
On the heights, beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand;
###### v3
beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries out:
###### v4
"To you, O people, I call, and my cry is to all that live.
###### v5
O simple ones, learn prudence; acquire intelligence, you who lack it.
###### v6
Hear, for I will speak noble things, and from my lips will come what is right;
###### v7
for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
###### v8
All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.
###### v9
They are all straight to one who understands and right to those who find knowledge.
###### v10
Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold;
###### v11
for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.
###### v12
I, wisdom, live with prudence, and I attain knowledge and discretion.
###### v13
The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.
###### v14
I have good advice and sound wisdom; I have insight, I have strength.
###### v15
By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just;
###### v16
by me rulers rule, and nobles, all who govern rightly.
###### v17
I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.
###### v18
Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and prosperity.
###### v19
My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver.
###### v20
I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,
###### v21
endowing with wealth those who love me, and filling their treasuries.
###### v22
The LORD created me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of long ago.
###### v23
Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.
###### v24
When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.
###### v25
Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth--
###### v26
when he had not yet made earth and fields, or the world's first bits of soil.
###### v27
When he established the heavens, I was there, when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,
###### v28
when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,
###### v29
when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
###### v30
then I was beside him, like a master worker; and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always,
###### v31
rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the human race.
###### v32
And now, my children, listen to me: happy are those who keep my ways.
###### v33
Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it.
###### v34
Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.
###### v35
For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD;
###### v36
but those who miss me injure themselves; all who hate me love death."
