###### v1
Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.
###### v2
Let another praise you, and not your own mouth-- a stranger, and not your own lips.
###### v3
A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty, but a fool's provocation is heavier than both.
###### v4
Wrath is cruel, anger is overwhelming, but who is able to stand before jealousy?
###### v5
Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
###### v6
Well meant are the wounds a friend inflicts, but profuse are the kisses of an enemy.

Like a bird that strays from its nest is one who strays from home.
###### v9
Perfume and incense make the heart glad, but the soul is torn by trouble.
###### v10
Do not forsake your friend or the friend of your parent; do not go to the house of your kindred in the day of your calamity. Better is a neighbor who is nearby than kindred who are far away.
###### v11
Be wise, my child, and make my heart glad, so that I may answer whoever reproaches me.

The clever see danger and hide; but the simple go on, and suffer for it.

Whoever blesses a neighbor with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, will be counted as cursing.

A continual dripping on a rainy day and a contentious wife are alike;

Iron sharpens iron, and one person sharpens the wits of another.

Just as water reflects the face, so one human heart reflects another.
###### v20
Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and human eyes are never satisfied.
###### v21
The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, so a person is tested by being praised.
###### v22
Crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, but the folly will not be driven out.
###### v23
Know well the condition of your flocks, and give attention to your herds;
###### v24
for riches do not last forever, nor a crown for all generations.
###### v25
When the grass is gone, and new growth appears, and the herbage of the mountains is gathered,
###### v26
the lambs will provide your clothing, and the goats the price of a field;
###### v27
there will be enough goats' milk for your food, for the food of your household and nourishment for your servant-girls.
