###### v1
The words of Agur son of Jakeh. An oracle. Thus says the man: I am weary, O God, I am weary, O God. How can I prevail?
###### v2
Surely I am too stupid to be human; I do not have human understanding.
###### v3
I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the holy ones.
###### v4
Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in the hollow of the hand? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is the person's name? And what is the name of the person's child? Surely you know!
###### v5
Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
###### v6
Do not add to his words, or else he will rebuke you, and you will be found a liar.
###### v7
Two things I ask of you; do not deny them to me before I die:
###### v8
Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that I need,
###### v9
or I shall be full, and deny you, and say, "Who is the LORD?" or I shall be poor, and steal, and profane the name of my God.
###### v10
Do not slander a servant to a master, or the servant will curse you, and you will be held guilty.
###### v11
There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.
###### v12
There are those who are pure in their own eyes yet are not cleansed of their filthiness.
###### v13
There are those-- how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift!
###### v14
There are those whose teeth are swords, whose teeth are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mortals.
###### v15
The leech has two daughters; "Give, give," they cry. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough":
###### v16
Sheol, the barren womb, the earth ever thirsty for water, and the fire that never says, "Enough."
###### v17
The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.
###### v18
Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand:
###### v19
the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a girl.
###### v20
This is the way of an adulteress: she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, "I have done no wrong."
###### v21
Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up:
###### v22
a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when glutted with food;
###### v23
an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maid when she succeeds her mistress.
###### v24
Four things on earth are small, yet they are exceedingly wise:
###### v25
the ants are a people without strength, yet they provide their food in the summer;
###### v26
the badgers are a people without power, yet they make their homes in the rocks;
###### v27
the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;
###### v28
the lizard can be grasped in the hand, yet it is found in kings' palaces.
###### v29
Three things are stately in their stride; four are stately in their gait:
###### v30
the lion, which is mightiest among wild animals and does not turn back before any;
###### v31
the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king striding before his people.
###### v32
If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth.
###### v33
For as pressing milk produces curds, and pressing the nose produces blood, so pressing anger produces strife.
