###### v1
The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
###### v2
For learning about wisdom and instruction, for understanding words of insight,
###### v3
for gaining instruction in wise dealing, righteousness, justice, and equity;
###### v4
to teach shrewdness to the simple, knowledge and prudence to the young--
###### v5
Let the wise also hear and gain in learning, and the discerning acquire skill,
###### v6
to understand a proverb and a figure, the words of the wise and their riddles.
###### v7
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.
###### v8
Hear, my child, your father's instruction, and do not reject your mother's teaching;
###### v9
for they are a fair garland for your head, and pendants for your neck.
###### v10
My child, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
###### v11
If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us wantonly ambush the innocent;
###### v12
like Sheol let us swallow them alive and whole, like those who go down to the Pit.
###### v13
We shall find all kinds of costly things; we shall fill our houses with booty.
###### v14
Throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"--
###### v15
my child, do not walk in their way, keep your foot from their paths;
###### v16
for their feet run to evil, and they hurry to shed blood.
###### v17
For in vain is the net baited while the bird is looking on;
###### v18
yet they lie in wait-- to kill themselves! and set an ambush-- for their own lives!
###### v19
Such is the end of all who are greedy for gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.
###### v20
Wisdom cries out in the street; in the squares she raises her voice.
###### v21
At the busiest corner she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:
###### v22
"How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?
###### v23
Give heed to my reproof; I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you.
###### v24
Because I have called and you refused, have stretched out my hand and no one heeded,
###### v25
and because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,
###### v26
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when panic strikes you,
###### v27
when panic strikes you like a storm, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.
###### v28
Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but will not find me.
###### v29
Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,
###### v30
would have none of my counsel, and despised all my reproof,
###### v31
therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and be sated with their own devices.
###### v32
For waywardness kills the simple, and the complacency of fools destroys them;
###### v33
but those who listen to me will be secure and will live at ease, without dread of disaster."
