###### v1
My child, if you have given your pledge to your neighbor, if you have bound yourself to another,
###### v2
you are snared by the utterance of your lips, caught by the words of your mouth.
###### v3
So do this, my child, and save yourself, for you have come into your neighbor's power: go, hurry, and plead with your neighbor.
###### v4
Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;
###### v5
save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
###### v6
Go to the ant, you lazybones; consider its ways, and be wise.
###### v7
Without having any chief or officer or ruler,
###### v8
it prepares its food in summer, and gathers its sustenance in harvest.
###### v9
How long will you lie there, O lazybones? When will you rise from your sleep?
###### v10
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
###### v11
and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want, like an armed warrior.
###### v12
A scoundrel and a villain goes around with crooked speech,
###### v13
winking the eyes, shuffling the feet, pointing the fingers,
###### v14
with perverted mind devising evil, continually sowing discord;
###### v15
on such a one calamity will descend suddenly; in a moment, damage beyond repair.
###### v16
There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him:
###### v17
haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
###### v18
a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that hurry to run to evil,
###### v19
a lying witness who testifies falsely, and one who sows discord in a family.
###### v20
My child, keep your father's commandment, and do not forsake your mother's teaching.
###### v21
Bind them upon your heart always; tie them around your neck.
###### v22
When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.
###### v23
For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,
###### v24
to preserve you from the wife of another, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
###### v25
Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;
###### v26
for a prostitute's fee is only a loaf of bread, but the wife of another stalks a man's very life.
###### v27
Can fire be carried in the bosom without burning one's clothes?
###### v28
Or can one walk on hot coals without scorching the feet?
###### v29
So is he who sleeps with his neighbor's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.
###### v30
Thieves are not despised who steal only to satisfy their appetite when they are hungry.
###### v31
Yet if they are caught, they will pay sevenfold; they will forfeit all the goods of their house.
###### v32
But he who commits adultery has no sense; he who does it destroys himself.
###### v33
He will get wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.
###### v34
For jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he shows no restraint when he takes revenge.
###### v35
He will accept no compensation, and refuses a bribe no matter how great.
