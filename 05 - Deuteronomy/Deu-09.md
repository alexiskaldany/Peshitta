###### v1
Hear, O Israel! You are about to cross the Jordan today, to go in and dispossess nations larger and mightier than you, great cities, fortified to the heavens,
###### v2
a strong and tall people, the offspring of the Anakim, whom you know. You have heard it said of them, "Who can stand up to the Anakim?"
###### v3
Know then today that the LORD your God is the one who crosses over before you as a devouring fire; he will defeat them and subdue them before you, so that you may dispossess and destroy them quickly, as the LORD has promised you.
###### v4
When the LORD your God thrusts them out before you, do not say to yourself, "It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has brought me in to occupy this land"; it is rather because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is dispossessing them before you.
###### v5
It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to occupy their land; but because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God is dispossessing them before you, in order to fulfill the promise that the LORD made on oath to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
###### v6
Know, then, that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to occupy because of your righteousness; for you are a stubborn people.
###### v7
Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness; you have been rebellious against the LORD from the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place.
###### v8
Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you.
###### v9
When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water.
###### v10
And the LORD gave me the two stone tablets written with the finger of God; on them were all the words that the LORD had spoken to you at the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly.
###### v11
At the end of forty days and forty nights the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
###### v12
Then the LORD said to me, "Get up, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have been quick to turn from the way that I commanded them; they have cast an image for themselves."
###### v13
Furthermore the LORD said to me, "I have seen that this people is indeed a stubborn people.
###### v14
Let me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and more numerous than they."
###### v15
So I turned and went down from the mountain, while the mountain was ablaze; the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
###### v16
Then I saw that you had indeed sinned against the LORD your God, by casting for yourselves an image of a calf; you had been quick to turn from the way that the LORD had commanded you.
###### v17
So I took hold of the two tablets and flung them from my two hands, smashing them before your eyes.
###### v18
Then I lay prostrate before the LORD as before, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin you had committed, provoking the LORD by doing what was evil in his sight.
###### v19
For I was afraid that the anger that the LORD bore against you was so fierce that he would destroy you. But the LORD listened to me that time also.
###### v20
The LORD was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him, but I interceded also on behalf of Aaron at that same time.
###### v21
Then I took the sinful thing you had made, the calf, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it thoroughly, until it was reduced to dust; and I threw the dust of it into the stream that runs down the mountain.
###### v22
At Taberah also, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you provoked the LORD to wrath.
###### v23
And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, "Go up and occupy the land that I have given you," you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God, neither trusting him nor obeying him.
###### v24
You have been rebellious against the LORD as long as he has known you.
###### v25
Throughout the forty days and forty nights that I lay prostrate before the LORD when the LORD intended to destroy you,
###### v26
I prayed to the LORD and said, "Lord GOD, do not destroy the people who are your very own possession, whom you redeemed in your greatness, whom you brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
###### v27
Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; pay no attention to the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin,
###### v28
otherwise the land from which you have brought us might say, 'Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to let them die in the wilderness.'
###### v29
For they are the people of your very own possession, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm."
