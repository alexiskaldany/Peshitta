###### v1
While they were at Hazeroth, Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had indeed married a Cushite woman);
###### v2
and they said, "Has the LORD spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" And the LORD heard it.
###### v3
Now the man Moses was very humble, more so than anyone else on the face of the earth.
###### v4
Suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting." So the three of them came out.
###### v5
Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the entrance of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward.
###### v6
And he said, "Hear my words: When there are prophets among you, I the LORD make myself known to them in visions; I speak to them in dreams.
###### v7
Not so with my servant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house.
###### v8
With him I speak face to face-- clearly, not in riddles; and he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
###### v9
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and he departed.
###### v10
When the cloud went away from over the tent, Miriam had become leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned towards Miriam and saw that she was leprous.
###### v11
Then Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, do not punish us for a sin that we have so foolishly committed.
###### v12
Do not let her be like one stillborn, whose flesh is half consumed when it comes out of its mother's womb."
###### v13
And Moses cried to the LORD, "O God, please heal her."
###### v14
But the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut out of the camp for seven days, and after that she may be brought in again."
###### v15
So Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days; and the people did not set out on the march until Miriam had been brought in again.
###### v16
After that the people set out from Hazeroth, and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
