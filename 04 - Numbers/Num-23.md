###### v1
Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
###### v2
Balak did as Balaam had said; and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
###### v3
Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your burnt offerings while I go aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you." And he went to a bare height.
###### v4
Then God met Balaam; and Balaam said to him, "I have arranged the seven altars, and have offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
###### v5
The LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and this is what you must say."
###### v6
So he returned to Balak, who was standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab.
###### v7
Then Balaam uttered his oracle, saying: "Balak has brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains: 'Come, curse Jacob for me; Come, denounce Israel!'
###### v8
How can I curse whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced?
###### v9
For from the top of the crags I see him, from the hills I behold him; Here is a people living alone, and not reckoning itself among the nations!
###### v10
Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the dust-cloud of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, and let my end be like his!"
###### v11
Then Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but now you have done nothing but bless them."
###### v12
He answered, "Must I not take care to say what the LORD puts into my mouth?"
###### v13
So Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place from which you may see them; you shall see only part of them, and shall not see them all; then curse them for me from there."
###### v14
So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah. He built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
###### v15
Balaam said to Balak, "Stand here beside your burnt offerings, while I meet the LORD over there.
###### v16
The LORD met Balaam, put a word into his mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and this is what you shall say."
###### v17
When he came to him, he was standing beside his burnt offerings with the officials of Moab. Balak said to him, "What has the LORD said?"
###### v18
Then Balaam uttered his oracle, saying: "Rise, Balak, and hear; listen to me, O son of Zippor:
###### v19
God is not a human being, that he should lie, or a mortal, that he should change his mind. Has he promised, and will he not do it? Has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?
###### v20
See, I received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot revoke it.
###### v21
He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob; nor has he seen trouble in Israel. The LORD their God is with them, acclaimed as a king among them.
###### v22
God, who brings them out of Egypt, is like the horns of a wild ox for them.
###### v23
Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel; now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, 'See what God has done!'
###### v24
Look, a people rising up like a lioness, and rousing itself like a lion! It does not lie down until it has eaten the prey and drunk the blood of the slain."
###### v25
Then Balak said to Balaam, "Do not curse them at all, and do not bless them at all."
###### v26
But Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not tell you, 'Whatever the LORD says, that is what I must do'?"
###### v27
So Balak said to Balaam, "Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there."
###### v28
So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the wasteland.
###### v29
Balaam said to Balak, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
###### v30
So Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
