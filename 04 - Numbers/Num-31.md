###### v1
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
###### v2
"Avenge the Israelites on the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your people."
###### v3
So Moses said to the people, "Arm some of your number for the war, so that they may go against Midian, to execute the LORD's vengeance on Midian.
###### v4
You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war."
###### v5
So out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe were conscripted, twelve thousand armed for battle.
###### v6
Moses sent them to the war, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for sounding the alarm in his hand.
###### v7
They did battle against Midian, as the LORD had commanded Moses, and killed every male.
###### v8
They killed the kings of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian, in addition to others who were slain by them; and they also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
###### v9
The Israelites took the women of Midian and their little ones captive; and they took all their cattle, their flocks, and all their goods as booty.
###### v10
All their towns where they had settled, and all their encampments, they burned,
###### v11
but they took all the spoil and all the booty, both people and animals.
###### v12
Then they brought the captives and the booty and the spoil to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the Israelites, at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
###### v13
Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.
###### v14
Moses became angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had come from service in the war.
###### v15
Moses said to them, "Have you allowed all the women to live?
###### v16
These women here, on Balaam's advice, made the Israelites act treacherously against the LORD in the affair of Peor, so that the plague came among the congregation of the LORD.
###### v17
Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man by sleeping with him.
###### v18
But all the young girls who have not known a man by sleeping with him, keep alive for yourselves.
###### v19
Camp outside the camp seven days; whoever of you has killed any person or touched a corpse, purify yourselves and your captives on the third and on the seventh day.
###### v20
You shall purify every garment, every article of skin, everything made of goats' hair, and every article of wood."
###### v21
Eleazar the priest said to the troops who had gone to battle: "This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded Moses:
###### v22
gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead--
###### v23
everything that can withstand fire, shall be passed through fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless it shall also be purified with the water for purification; and whatever cannot withstand fire, shall be passed through the water.
###### v24
You must wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; afterward you may come into the camp."
###### v25
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
###### v26
"You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the ancestral houses of the congregation make an inventory of the booty captured, both human and animal.
###### v27
Divide the booty into two parts, between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
###### v28
From the share of the warriors who went out to battle, set aside as tribute for the LORD, one item out of every five hundred, whether persons, oxen, donkeys, sheep, or goats.
###### v29
Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD.
###### v30
But from the Israelites' half you shall take one out of every fifty, whether persons, oxen, donkeys, sheep, or goats-- all the animals-- and give them to the Levites who have charge of the tabernacle of the LORD."
###### v31
Then Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD had commanded Moses:
###### v32
The booty remaining from the spoil that the troops had taken totaled six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,
###### v33
seventy-two thousand oxen,
###### v34
sixty-one thousand donkeys,
###### v35
and thirty-two thousand persons in all, women who had not known a man by sleeping with him.
###### v36
The half-share, the portion of those who had gone out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep and goats,
###### v37
and the LORD's tribute of sheep and goats was six hundred seventy-five.
###### v38
The oxen were thirty-six thousand, of which the LORD's tribute was seventy-two.
###### v39
The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred, of which the LORD's tribute was sixty-one.
###### v40
The persons were sixteen thousand, of which the LORD's tribute was thirty-two persons.
###### v41
Moses gave the tribute, the offering for the LORD, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
###### v42
As for the Israelites' half, which Moses separated from that of the troops,
###### v43
the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep and goats,
###### v44
thirty-six thousand oxen,
###### v45
thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
###### v46
and sixteen thousand persons.
###### v47
From the Israelites' half Moses took one of every fifty, both of persons and of animals, and gave them to the Levites who had charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
###### v48
Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, approached Moses,
###### v49
and said to Moses, "Your servants have counted the warriors who are under our command, and not one of us is missing.
###### v50
And we have brought the LORD's offering, what each of us found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and pendants, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."
###### v51
Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from them, all in the form of crafted articles.
###### v52
And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the LORD, from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.
###### v53
(The troops had all taken plunder for themselves.)
###### v54
So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
