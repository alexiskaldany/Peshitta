###### v1
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
###### v2
Make two silver trumpets; you shall make them of hammered work; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation, and for breaking camp.
###### v3
When both are blown, the whole congregation shall assemble before you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
###### v4
But if only one is blown, then the leaders, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall assemble before you.
###### v5
When you blow an alarm, the camps on the east side shall set out;
###### v6
when you blow a second alarm, the camps on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out.
###### v7
But when the assembly is to be gathered, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
###### v8
The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; this shall be a perpetual institution for you throughout your generations.
###### v9
When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, so that you may be remembered before the LORD your God and be saved from your enemies.
###### v10
Also on your days of rejoicing, at your appointed festivals, and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over your sacrifices of well-being; they shall serve as a reminder on your behalf before the LORD your God: I am the LORD your God.

###### v30
But he said to him, "I will not go, but I will go back to my own land and to my kindred."
###### v31
He said, "Do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us.
###### v32
Moreover, if you go with us, whatever good the LORD does for us, the same we will do for you."
###### v33
So they set out from the mount of the LORD three days' journey with the ark of the covenant of the LORD going before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them,
###### v34
