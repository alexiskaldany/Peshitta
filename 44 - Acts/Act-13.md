###### v1
Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the ruler, and Saul.
###### v2
While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
###### v3
Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.
###### v4
So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
###### v5
When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also to assist them.
###### v6
When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they met a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus.
###### v7
He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and wanted to hear the word of God.
###### v8
But the magician Elymas (for that is the translation of his name) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
###### v9
But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him
###### v10
and said, "You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?
###### v11
And now listen-- the hand of the Lord is against you, and you will be blind for a while, unable to see the sun." Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he went about groping for someone to lead him by the hand.
###### v12
When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.
###### v13
Then Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John, however, left them and returned to Jerusalem;
###### v14
but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
###### v15
After the reading of the law and the prophets, the officials of the synagogue sent them a message, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, give it."
###### v16
So Paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak: "You Israelites, and others who fear God, listen.
###### v17
The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.
###### v18
For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.
###### v19
After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance
###### v20
for about four hundred fifty years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.
###### v21
Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.
###### v22
When he had removed him, he made David their king. In his testimony about him he said, 'I have found David, son of Jesse, to be a man after my heart, who will carry out all my wishes.'
###### v23
Of this man's posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised;
###### v24
before his coming John had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
###### v25
And as John was finishing his work, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but one is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet.'
###### v26
"My brothers, you descendants of Abraham's family, and others who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.
###### v27
Because the residents of Jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize him or understand the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath, they fulfilled those words by condemning him.
###### v28
Even though they found no cause for a sentence of death, they asked Pilate to have him killed.
###### v29
When they had carried out everything that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.
###### v30
But God raised him from the dead;
###### v31
and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and they are now his witnesses to the people.
###### v32
And we bring you the good news that what God promised to our ancestors
###### v33
he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, 'You are my Son; today I have begotten you.'
###### v34
As to his raising him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way, 'I will give you the holy promises made to David.'
###### v35
Therefore he has also said in another psalm, 'You will not let your Holy One experience corruption.'
###### v36
For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, died, was laid beside his ancestors, and experienced corruption;
###### v37
but he whom God raised up experienced no corruption.
###### v38
Let it be known to you therefore, my brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you;
###### v39
by this Jesus everyone who believes is set free from all those sins from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.
###### v40
Beware, therefore, that what the prophets said does not happen to you:
###### v41
'Look, you scoffers! Be amazed and perish, for in your days I am doing a work, a work that you will never believe, even if someone tells you.'"
###### v42
As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people urged them to speak about these things again the next sabbath.
###### v43
When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
###### v44
The next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
###### v45
But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy; and blaspheming, they contradicted what was spoken by Paul.
###### v46
Then both Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, "It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you reject it and judge yourselves to be unworthy of eternal life, we are now turning to the Gentiles.
###### v47
For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, 'I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles, so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"
###### v48
When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and praised the word of the Lord; and as many as had been destined for eternal life became believers.
###### v49
Thus the word of the Lord spread throughout the region.
###### v50
But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their region.
###### v51
So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them, and went to Iconium.
###### v52
And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
