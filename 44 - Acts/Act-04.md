###### v1
While Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them,
###### v2
much annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming that in Jesus there is the resurrection of the dead.
###### v3
So they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.
###### v4
But many of those who heard the word believed; and they numbered about five thousand.
###### v5
The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem,
###### v6
with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family.
###### v7
When they had made the prisoners stand in their midst, they inquired, "By what power or by what name did you do this?"
###### v8
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders,
###### v9
if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed,
###### v10
let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead.
###### v11
This Jesus is 'the stone that was rejected by you, the builders; it has become the cornerstone.'
###### v12
There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved."
###### v13
Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized them as companions of Jesus.
###### v14
When they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.
###### v15
So they ordered them to leave the council while they discussed the matter with one another.
###### v16
They said, "What will we do with them? For it is obvious to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them; we cannot deny it.
###### v17
But to keep it from spreading further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name."
###### v18
So they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
###### v19
But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in God's sight to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge;
###### v20
for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard."
###### v21
After threatening them again, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all of them praised God for what had happened.
###### v22
For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.
###### v23
After they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
###### v24
When they heard it, they raised their voices together to God and said, "Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and everything in them,
###### v25
it is you who said by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant: 'Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?
###### v26
The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers have gathered together against the Lord and against his Messiah.'
###### v27
For in this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,
###### v28
to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.
###### v29
And now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,
###### v30
while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
###### v31
When they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.
###### v32
Now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions, but everything they owned was held in common.
###### v33
With great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
###### v34
There was not a needy person among them, for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold.
###### v35
They laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.
###### v36
There was a Levite, a native of Cyprus, Joseph, to whom the apostles gave the name Barnabas (which means "son of encouragement").
###### v37
He sold a field that belonged to him, then brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
