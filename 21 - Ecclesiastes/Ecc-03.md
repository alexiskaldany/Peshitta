###### v1
For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:
###### v2
a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
###### v3
a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
###### v4
a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
###### v5
a time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
###### v6
a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to throw away;
###### v7
a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
###### v8
a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.
###### v9
What gain have the workers from their toil?
###### v10
I have seen the business that God has given to everyone to be busy with.
###### v11
He has made everything suitable for its time; moreover he has put a sense of past and future into their minds, yet they cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.
###### v12
I know that there is nothing better for them than to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live;
###### v13
moreover, it is God's gift that all should eat and drink and take pleasure in all their toil.
###### v14
I know that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; God has done this, so that all should stand in awe before him.
###### v15
That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already is; and God seeks out what has gone by.
###### v16
Moreover I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, wickedness was there, and in the place of righteousness, wickedness was there as well.
###### v17
I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for he has appointed a time for every matter, and for every work.
###### v18
I said in my heart with regard to human beings that God is testing them to show that they are but animals.
###### v19
For the fate of humans and the fate of animals is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and humans have no advantage over the animals; for all is vanity.
###### v20
All go to one place; all are from the dust, and all turn to dust again.
###### v21
Who knows whether the human spirit goes upward and the spirit of animals goes downward to the earth?
###### v22
So I saw that there is nothing better than that all should enjoy their work, for that is their lot; who can bring them to see what will be after them?
