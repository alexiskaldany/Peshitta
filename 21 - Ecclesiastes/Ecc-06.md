###### v1
There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy upon humankind:
###### v2
those to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that they lack nothing of all that they desire, yet God does not enable them to enjoy these things, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous ill.
###### v3
A man may beget a hundred children, and live many years; but however many are the days of his years, if he does not enjoy life's good things, or has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
###### v4
For it comes into vanity and goes into darkness, and in darkness its name is covered;
###### v5
moreover it has not seen the sun or known anything; yet it finds rest rather than he.
###### v6
Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy no good-- do not all go to one place?
###### v7
All human toil is for the mouth, yet the appetite is not satisfied.
###### v8
For what advantage have the wise over fools? And what do the poor have who know how to conduct themselves before the living?
###### v9
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire; this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
###### v10
Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what human beings are, and that they are not able to dispute with those who are stronger.
###### v11
The more words, the more vanity, so how is one the better?
###### v12
For who knows what is good for mortals while they live the few days of their vain life, which they pass like a shadow? For who can tell them what will be after them under the sun?
