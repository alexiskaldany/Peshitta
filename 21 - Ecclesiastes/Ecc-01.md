# Ecclesiastes 1

[[Ecclesiastes]] | [[Ecc-02|Ecclesiastes - Chapter 2 ]]
***

###### v1
The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
###### v2
Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.
###### v3
What do people gain from all the toil at which they toil under the sun?
###### v4
A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.
###### v5
The sun rises and the sun goes down, and hurries to the place where it rises.
###### v6
The wind blows to the south, and goes around to the north; round and round goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.
###### v7
All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they continue to flow.
###### v8
All things are wearisome; more than one can express; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, or the ear filled with hearing.
###### v9
What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun.
###### v10
Is there a thing of which it is said, "See, this is new"? It has already been, in the ages before us.
###### v11
The people of long ago are not remembered, nor will there be any remembrance of people yet to come by those who come after them.
###### v12
I, the Teacher, when king over Israel in Jerusalem,
###### v13
applied my mind to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven; it is an unhappy business that God has given to human beings to be busy with.
###### v14
I saw all the deeds that are done under the sun; and see, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.
###### v15
What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.
###### v16
I said to myself, "I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
###### v17
And I applied my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a chasing after wind.
###### v18
For in much wisdom is much vexation, and those who increase knowledge increase sorrow.
