***

###### v1
Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a foul odor; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
###### v2
The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of a fool to the left.
###### v3
Even when fools walk on the road, they lack sense, and show to everyone that they are fools.
###### v4
If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your post, for calmness will undo great offenses.
###### v5
There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as great an error as if it proceeded from the ruler:
###### v6
folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.
###### v7
I have seen slaves on horseback, and princes walking on foot like slaves.
###### v8
Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall will be bitten by a snake.
###### v9
Whoever quarries stones will be hurt by them; and whoever splits logs will be endangered by them.
###### v10
If the iron is blunt, and one does not whet the edge, then more strength must be exerted; but wisdom helps one to succeed.
###### v11
If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage in a charmer.
###### v12
Words spoken by the wise bring them favor, but the lips of fools consume them.
###### v13
The words of their mouths begin in foolishness, and their talk ends in wicked madness;
###### v14
yet fools talk on and on. No one knows what is to happen, and who can tell anyone what the future holds?
###### v15
The toil of fools wears them out, for they do not even know the way to town.
###### v16
Alas for you, O land, when your king is a servant, and your princes feast in the morning!
###### v17
Happy are you, O land, when your king is a nobleman, and your princes feast at the proper time-- for strength, and not for drunkenness!
###### v18
Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through indolence the house leaks.
###### v19
Feasts are made for laughter; wine gladdens life, and money meets every need.
###### v20
Do not curse the king, even in your thoughts, or curse the rich, even in your bedroom; for a bird of the air may carry your voice, or some winged creature tell the matter.
