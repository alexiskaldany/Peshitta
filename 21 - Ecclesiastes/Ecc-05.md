###### v1
Guard your steps when you go to the house of God; to draw near to listen is better than the sacrifice offered by fools; for they do not know how to keep from doing evil.
###### v2
Never be rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be quick to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven, and you upon earth; therefore let your words be few.
###### v3
For dreams come with many cares, and a fool's voice with many words.
###### v4
When you make a vow to God, do not delay fulfilling it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Fulfill what you vow.
###### v5
It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not fulfill it.
###### v6
Do not let your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake; why should God be angry at your words, and destroy the work of your hands?
###### v7
With many dreams come vanities and a multitude of words; but fear God.
###### v8
If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and right, do not be amazed at the matter; for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.
###### v9
But all things considered, this is an advantage for a land: a king for a plowed field.
###### v10
The lover of money will not be satisfied with money; nor the lover of wealth, with gain. This also is vanity.
###### v11
When goods increase, those who eat them increase; and what gain has their owner but to see them with his eyes?
###### v12
Sweet is the sleep of laborers, whether they eat little or much; but the surfeit of the rich will not let them sleep.
###### v13
There is a grievous ill that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owners to their hurt,
###### v14
and those riches were lost in a bad venture; though they are parents of children, they have nothing in their hands.
###### v15
As they came from their mother's womb, so they shall go again, naked as they came; they shall take nothing for their toil, which they may carry away with their hands.
###### v16
This also is a grievous ill: just as they came, so shall they go; and what gain do they have from toiling for the wind?
###### v17
Besides, all their days they eat in darkness, in much vexation and sickness and resentment.
###### v18
This is what I have seen to be good: it is fitting to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of the life God gives us; for this is our lot.
###### v19
Likewise all to whom God gives wealth and possessions and whom he enables to enjoy them, and to accept their lot and find enjoyment in their toil-- this is the gift of God.
###### v20
For they will scarcely brood over the days of their lives, because God keeps them occupied with the joy of their hearts.
