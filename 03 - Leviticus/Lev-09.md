###### v1
On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
###### v2
He said to Aaron, "Take a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
###### v3
And say to the people of Israel, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering; a calf and a lamb, yearlings without blemish, for a burnt offering;
###### v4
and an ox and a ram for an offering of well-being to sacrifice before the LORD; and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.'"
###### v5
They brought what Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting; and the whole congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
###### v6
And Moses said, "This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."
###### v7
Then Moses said to Aaron, "Draw near to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people; and sacrifice the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as the LORD has commanded."
###### v8
Aaron drew near to the altar, and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
###### v9
The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; and the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.
###### v10
But the fat, the kidneys, and the appendage of the liver from the sin offering he turned into smoke on the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses;
###### v11
and the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
###### v12
Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. Aaron's sons brought him the blood, and he dashed it against all sides of the altar.
###### v13
And they brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, and the head, which he turned into smoke on the altar.
###### v14
He washed the entrails and the legs and, with the burnt offering, turned them into smoke on the altar.
###### v15
Next he presented the people's offering. He took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people, and slaughtered it, and presented it as a sin offering like the first one.
###### v16
He presented the burnt offering, and sacrificed it according to regulation.
###### v17
He presented the grain offering, and, taking a handful of it, he turned it into smoke on the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.
###### v18
He slaughtered the ox and the ram as a sacrifice of well-being for the people. Aaron's sons brought him the blood, which he dashed against all sides of the altar,
###### v19
and the fat of the ox and of the ram-- the broad tail, the fat that covers the entrails, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the appendage of the liver.
###### v20
They first laid the fat on the breasts, and the fat was turned into smoke on the altar;
###### v21
and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron raised as an elevation offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded.
###### v22
Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came down after sacrificing the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the offering of well-being.
###### v23
Moses and Aaron entered the tent of meeting, and then came out and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
###### v24
Fire came out from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.
