###### v1
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
###### v2
Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil of beaten olives for the lamp, that a light may be kept burning regularly.
###### v3
Aaron shall set it up in the tent of meeting, outside the curtain of the covenant, to burn from evening to morning before the LORD regularly; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
###### v4
He shall set up the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold before the LORD regularly.
###### v5
You shall take choice flour, and bake twelve loaves of it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each loaf.
###### v6
You shall place them in two rows, six in a row, on the table of pure gold.
###### v7
You shall put pure frankincense with each row, to be a token offering for the bread, as an offering by fire to the LORD.
###### v8
Every sabbath day Aaron shall set them in order before the LORD regularly as a commitment of the people of Israel, as a covenant forever.
###### v9
They shall be for Aaron and his descendants, who shall eat them in a holy place, for they are most holy portions for him from the offerings by fire to the LORD, a perpetual due.
###### v10
A man whose mother was an Israelite and whose father was an Egyptian came out among the people of Israel; and the Israelite woman's son and a certain Israelite began fighting in the camp.
###### v11
The Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name in a curse. And they brought him to Moses-- now his mother's name was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan--
###### v12
and they put him in custody, until the decision of the LORD should be made clear to them.
###### v13
The LORD said to Moses, saying:
###### v14
Take the blasphemer outside the camp; and let all who were within hearing lay their hands on his head, and let the whole congregation stone him.
###### v15
And speak to the people of Israel, saying: Anyone who curses God shall bear the sin.
###### v16
One who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall be put to death; the whole congregation shall stone the blasphemer. Aliens as well as citizens, when they blaspheme the Name, shall be put to death.
###### v17
Anyone who kills a human being shall be put to death.
###### v18
Anyone who kills an animal shall make restitution for it, life for life.
###### v19
Anyone who maims another shall suffer the same injury in return:
###### v20
fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; the injury inflicted is the injury to be suffered.
###### v21
One who kills an animal shall make restitution for it; but one who kills a human being shall be put to death.
###### v22
You shall have one law for the alien and for the citizen: for I am the LORD your God.
###### v23
Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel; and they took the blasphemer outside the camp, and stoned him to death. The people of Israel did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
