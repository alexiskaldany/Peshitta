###### v1
The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
###### v2
When a person has on the skin of his body a swelling or an eruption or a spot, and it turns into a leprous disease on the skin of his body, he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests.
###### v3
The priest shall examine the disease on the skin of his body, and if the hair in the diseased area has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous disease; after the priest has examined him he shall pronounce him ceremonially unclean.
###### v4
But if the spot is white in the skin of his body, and appears no deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall confine the diseased person for seven days.
###### v5
The priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and if he sees that the disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall confine him seven days more.
###### v6
The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the disease has abated and the disease has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only an eruption; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
###### v7
But if the eruption spreads in the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest.
###### v8
The priest shall make an examination, and if the eruption has spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.
###### v9
When a person contracts a leprous disease, he shall be brought to the priest.
###### v10
The priest shall make an examination, and if there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the swelling,
###### v11
it is a chronic leprous disease in the skin of his body. The priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not confine him, for he is unclean.
###### v12
But if the disease breaks out in the skin, so that it covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see,
###### v13
then the priest shall make an examination, and if the disease has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; since it has all turned white, he is clean.
###### v14
But if raw flesh ever appears on him, he shall be unclean;
###### v15
the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean. Raw flesh is unclean, for it is a leprous disease.
###### v16
But if the raw flesh again turns white, he shall come to the priest;
###### v17
the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean. He is clean.
###### v18
When there is on the skin of one's body a boil that has healed,
###### v19
and in the place of the boil there appears a white swelling or a reddish-white spot, it shall be shown to the priest.
###### v20
The priest shall make an examination, and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; this is a leprous disease, broken out in the boil.
###### v21
But if the priest examines it and the hair on it is not white, nor is it deeper than the skin but has abated, the priest shall confine him seven days.
###### v22
If it spreads in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is diseased.
###### v23
But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil; the priest shall pronounce him clean.
###### v24
Or, when the body has a burn on the skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot, reddish-white or white,
###### v25
the priest shall examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, it is a leprous disease; it has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. This is a leprous disease.
###### v26
But if the priest examines it and the hair in the spot is not white, and it is no deeper than the skin but has abated, the priest shall confine him seven days.
###### v27
The priest shall examine him the seventh day; if it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. This is a leprous disease.
###### v28
But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread in the skin but has abated, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar of the burn.
###### v29
When a man or woman has a disease on the head or in the beard,
###### v30
the priest shall examine the disease. If it appears deeper than the skin and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an itch, a leprous disease of the head or the beard.
###### v31
If the priest examines the itching disease, and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest shall confine the person with the itching disease for seven days.
###### v32
On the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch; if the itch has not spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin,
###### v33
he shall shave, but the itch he shall not shave. The priest shall confine the person with the itch for seven days more.
###### v34
On the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch; if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean.
###### v35
But if the itch spreads in the skin after he was pronounced clean,
###### v36
the priest shall examine him. If the itch has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
###### v37
But if in his eyes the itch is checked, and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
###### v38
When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots,
###### v39
the priest shall make an examination, and if the spots on the skin of the body are of a dull white, it is a rash that has broken out on the skin; he is clean.
###### v40
If anyone loses the hair from his head, he is bald but he is clean.
###### v41
If he loses the hair from his forehead and temples, he has baldness of the forehead but he is clean.
###### v42
But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white diseased spot, it is a leprous disease breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.
###### v43
The priest shall examine him; if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, which resembles a leprous disease in the skin of the body,
###### v44
he is leprous, he is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean; the disease is on his head.
###### v45
The person who has the leprous disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head be disheveled; and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out, "Unclean, unclean."
###### v46
He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.
###### v47
Concerning clothing: when a leprous disease appears in it, in woolen or linen cloth,
###### v48
in warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin,
###### v49
if the disease shows greenish or reddish in the garment, whether in warp or woof or in skin or in anything made of skin, it is a leprous disease and shall be shown to the priest.
###### v50
The priest shall examine the disease, and put the diseased article aside for seven days.
###### v51
He shall examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread in the cloth, in warp or woof, or in the skin, whatever be the use of the skin, this is a spreading leprous disease; it is unclean.
###### v52
He shall burn the clothing, whether diseased in warp or woof, woolen or linen, or anything of skin, for it is a spreading leprous disease; it shall be burned in fire.
###### v53
If the priest makes an examination, and the disease has not spread in the clothing, in warp or woof or in anything of skin,
###### v54
the priest shall command them to wash the article in which the disease appears, and he shall put it aside seven days more.
###### v55
The priest shall examine the diseased article after it has been washed. If the diseased spot has not changed color, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in fire, whether the leprous spot is on the inside or on the outside.
###### v56
If the priest makes an examination, and the disease has abated after it is washed, he shall tear the spot out of the cloth, in warp or woof, or out of skin.
###### v57
If it appears again in the garment, in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading; you shall burn with fire that in which the disease appears.
###### v58
But the cloth, warp or woof, or anything of skin from which the disease disappears when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and it shall be clean.
###### v59
This is the ritual for a leprous disease in a cloth of wool or linen, either in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, to decide whether it is clean or unclean.
