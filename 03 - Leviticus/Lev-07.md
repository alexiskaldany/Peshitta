###### v1
This is the ritual of the guilt offering. It is most holy;
###### v2
at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughtered, they shall slaughter the guilt offering, and its blood shall be dashed against all sides of the altar.
###### v3
All its fat shall be offered: the broad tail, the fat that covers the entrails,
###### v4
the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver, which shall be removed with the kidneys.
###### v5
The priest shall turn them into smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to the LORD; it is a guilt offering.
###### v6
Every male among the priests shall eat of it; it shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.
###### v7
The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is the same ritual for them; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.
###### v8
So, too, the priest who offers anyone's burnt offering shall keep the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered.
###### v9
And every grain offering baked in the oven, and all that is prepared in a pan or on a griddle, shall belong to the priest who offers it.
###### v10
But every other grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron equally.
###### v11
This is the ritual of the sacrifice of the offering of well-being that one may offer to the LORD.
###### v12
If you offer it for thanksgiving, you shall offer with the thank offering unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of choice flour well soaked in oil.
###### v13
With your thanksgiving sacrifice of well-being you shall bring your offering with cakes of leavened bread.
###### v14
From this you shall offer one cake from each offering, as a gift to the LORD; it shall belong to the priest who dashes the blood of the offering of well-being.
###### v15
And the flesh of your thanksgiving sacrifice of well-being shall be eaten on the day it is offered; you shall not leave any of it until morning.
###### v16
But if the sacrifice you offer is a votive offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that you offer your sacrifice, and what is left of it shall be eaten the next day;
###### v17
but what is left of the flesh of the sacrifice shall be burned up on the third day.
###### v18
If any of the flesh of your sacrifice of well-being is eaten on the third day, it shall not be acceptable, nor shall it be credited to the one who offers it; it shall be an abomination, and the one who eats of it shall incur guilt.
###### v19
Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burned up. As for other flesh, all who are clean may eat such flesh.
###### v20
But those who eat flesh from the LORD's sacrifice of well-being while in a state of uncleanness shall be cut off from their kin.
###### v21
When any one of you touches any unclean thing-- human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean creature-- and then eats flesh from the LORD's sacrifice of well-being, you shall be cut off from your kin.
###### v22
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
###### v23
Speak to the people of Israel, saying: You shall eat no fat of ox or sheep or goat.
###### v24
The fat of an animal that died or was torn by wild animals may be put to any use, but you must not eat it.
###### v25
If any one of you eats the fat from an animal of which an offering by fire may be made to the LORD, you who eat it shall be cut off from your kin.
###### v26
You must not eat any blood whatever, either of bird or of animal, in any of your settlements.
###### v27
Any one of you who eats any blood shall be cut off from your kin.
###### v28
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
###### v29
Speak to the people of Israel, saying: Any one of you who would offer to the LORD your sacrifice of well-being must yourself bring to the LORD your offering from your sacrifice of well-being.
###### v30
Your own hands shall bring the LORD's offering by fire; you shall bring the fat with the breast, so that the breast may be raised as an elevation offering before the LORD.
###### v31
The priest shall turn the fat into smoke on the altar, but the breast shall belong to Aaron and his sons.
###### v32
And the right thigh from your sacrifices of well-being you shall give to the priest as an offering;
###### v33
the one among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood and fat of the offering of well-being shall have the right thigh for a portion.
###### v34
For I have taken the breast of the elevation offering, and the thigh that is offered, from the people of Israel, from their sacrifices of well-being, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel.
###### v35
This is the portion allotted to Aaron and to his sons from the offerings made by fire to the LORD, once they have been brought forward to serve the LORD as priests;
###### v36
these the LORD commanded to be given them, when he anointed them, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel throughout their generations.
###### v37
This is the ritual of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the offering of ordination, and the sacrifice of well-being,
###### v38
which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, when he commanded the people of Israel to bring their offerings to the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.
