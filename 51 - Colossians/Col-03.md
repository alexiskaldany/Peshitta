###### v1
So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
###### v2
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth,
###### v3
for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
###### v4
When Christ who is your life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.
###### v5
Put to death, therefore, whatever in you is earthly: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry).
###### v6
On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient.
###### v7
These are the ways you also once followed, when you were living that life.
###### v8
But now you must get rid of all such things-- anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive language from your mouth.
###### v9
Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices
###### v10
and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator.
###### v11
In that renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all!
###### v12
As God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience.
###### v13
Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.
###### v14
Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.
###### v15
And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful.
###### v16
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; teach and admonish one another in all wisdom; and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God.
###### v17
And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
###### v18
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
###### v19
Husbands, love your wives and never treat them harshly.
###### v20
Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is your acceptable duty in the Lord.
###### v21
Fathers, do not provoke your children, or they may lose heart.
###### v22
Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only while being watched and in order to please them, but wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord.
###### v23
Whatever your task, put yourselves into it, as done for the Lord and not for your masters,
###### v24
since you know that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward; you serve the Lord Christ.
###### v25
For the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong has been done, and there is no partiality.
