###### v1
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and co-worker,
###### v2
to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:
###### v3
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
###### v4
When I remember you in my prayers, I always thank my God
###### v5
because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the Lord Jesus.
###### v6
I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for Christ.
###### v7
I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother.
###### v8
For this reason, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do your duty,
###### v9
yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love-- and I, Paul, do this as an old man, and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus.
###### v10
I am appealing to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment.
###### v11
Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me.
###### v12
I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.
###### v13
I wanted to keep him with me, so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel;
###### v14
but I preferred to do nothing without your consent, in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced.
###### v15
Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back forever,
###### v16
no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother-- especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
###### v17
So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
###### v18
If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
###### v19
I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. I say nothing about your owing me even your own self.
###### v20
Yes, brother, let me have this benefit from you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ.
###### v21
Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
###### v22
One thing more-- prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping through your prayers to be restored to you.
###### v23
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,
###### v24
and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
###### v25
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
