Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with rejoicing, with thanksgivings and with singing, with cymbals, harps, and lyres.
###### v28
The companies of the singers gathered together from the circuit around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites;
###### v29
also from Beth-gilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built for themselves villages around Jerusalem.
###### v30
And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people and the gates and the wall.
###### v31
Then I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession. One went to the right on the wall to the Dung Gate;
###### v32
and after them went Hoshaiah and half the officials of Judah,
###### v33
and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
###### v34
Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
###### v35

###### v38
The other company of those who gave thanks went to the left, and I followed them with half of the people on the wall, above the Tower of the Ovens, to the Broad Wall,

and above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, and by the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate; and they came to a halt at the Gate of the Guard.

and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang with Jezrahiah as their leader.
###### v43
They offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and children also rejoiced. The joy of Jerusalem was heard far away.
###### v44
On that day men were appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required by the law for the priests and for the Levites from the fields belonging to the towns; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who ministered.
###### v45
They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the command of David and his son Solomon.
###### v46
For in the days of David and Asaph long ago there was a leader of the singers, and there were songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
###### v47
In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers. They set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the descendants of Aaron.
