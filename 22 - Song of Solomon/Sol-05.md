###### v1
I come to my garden, my sister, my bride; I gather my myrrh with my spice, I eat my honeycomb with my honey, I drink my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love.
###### v2
I slept, but my heart was awake. Listen! my beloved is knocking. "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night."
###### v3
I had put off my garment; how could I put it on again? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them?
###### v4
My beloved thrust his hand into the opening, and my inmost being yearned for him.
###### v5
I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.
###### v6
I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and was gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but did not find him; I called him, but he gave no answer.
###### v7
Making their rounds in the city the sentinels found me; they beat me, they wounded me, they took away my mantle, those sentinels of the walls.
###### v8
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, tell him this: I am faint with love.
###### v9
What is your beloved more than another beloved, O fairest among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you thus adjure us?
###### v10
My beloved is all radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.
###### v11
His head is the finest gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven.
###### v12
His eyes are like doves beside springs of water, bathed in milk, fitly set.
###### v13
His cheeks are like beds of spices, yielding fragrance. His lips are lilies, distilling liquid myrrh.
###### v14
His arms are rounded gold, set with jewels. His body is ivory work, encrusted with sapphires.
###### v15
His legs are alabaster columns, set upon bases of gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
###### v16
His speech is most sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
