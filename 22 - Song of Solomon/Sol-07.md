###### v1
How graceful are your feet in sandals, O queenly maiden! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand.
###### v2
Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies.
###### v3
Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
###### v4
Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, overlooking Damascus.
###### v5
Your head crowns you like Carmel, and your flowing locks are like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses.
###### v6
How fair and pleasant you are, O loved one, delectable maiden!
###### v7
You are stately as a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters.
###### v8
I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its branches. Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples,
###### v9
and your kisses like the best wine that goes down smoothly, gliding over lips and teeth.
###### v10
I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.
###### v11
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields, and lodge in the villages;
###### v12
let us go out early to the vineyards, and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.
###### v13
The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and over our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.
