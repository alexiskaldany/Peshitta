###### v1
How beautiful you are, my love, how very beautiful! Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats, moving down the slopes of Gilead.
###### v2
Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes that have come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and not one among them is bereaved.
###### v3
Your lips are like a crimson thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.
###### v4
Your neck is like the tower of David, built in courses; on it hang a thousand bucklers, all of them shields of warriors.
###### v5
Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that feed among the lilies.
###### v6
Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, I will hasten to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.
###### v7
You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.
###### v8
Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the peak of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.
###### v9
You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride, you have ravished my heart with a glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
###### v10
How sweet is your love, my sister, my bride! how much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice!
###### v11
Your lips distill nectar, my bride; honey and milk are under your tongue; the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon.
###### v12
A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a garden locked, a fountain sealed.
###### v13
Your channel is an orchard of pomegranates with all choicest fruits, henna with nard,
###### v14
nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices--
###### v15
a garden fountain, a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon.
###### v16
Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden that its fragrance may be wafted abroad. Let my beloved come to his garden, and eat its choicest fruits.
