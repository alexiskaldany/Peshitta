***

###### v1
The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.
###### v2
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine,
###### v3
your anointing oils are fragrant, your name is perfume poured out; therefore the maidens love you.
###### v4
Draw me after you, let us make haste. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love more than wine; rightly do they love you.
###### v5
I am black and beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
###### v6
Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has gazed on me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept!
###### v7
Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who is veiled beside the flocks of your companions?
###### v8
If you do not know, O fairest among women, follow the tracks of the flock, and pasture your kids beside the shepherds' tents.
###### v9
I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots.
###### v10
Your cheeks are comely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.
###### v11
We will make you ornaments of gold, studded with silver.
###### v12
While the king was on his couch, my nard gave forth its fragrance.
###### v13
My beloved is to me a bag of myrrh that lies between my breasts.
###### v14
My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En-gedi.
###### v15
Ah, you are beautiful, my love; ah, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves.
###### v16
Ah, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly lovely. Our couch is green;
###### v17
the beams of our house are cedar, our rafters are pine.
