###### v1
Now the wife of a member of the company of prophets cried to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant feared the LORD, but a creditor has come to take my two children as slaves."
###### v2
Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?" She answered, "Your servant has nothing in the house, except a jar of oil."
###### v3
He said, "Go outside, borrow vessels from all your neighbors, empty vessels and not just a few.
###### v4
Then go in, and shut the door behind you and your children, and start pouring into all these vessels; when each is full, set it aside."
###### v5
So she left him and shut the door behind her and her children; they kept bringing vessels to her, and she kept pouring.
###### v6
When the vessels were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another vessel." But he said to her, "There are no more." Then the oil stopped flowing.
###### v7
She came and told the man of God, and he said, "Go sell the oil and pay your debts, and you and your children can live on the rest."
###### v8
One day Elisha was passing through Shunem, where a wealthy woman lived, who urged him to have a meal. So whenever he passed that way, he would stop there for a meal.
###### v9
She said to her husband, "Look, I am sure that this man who regularly passes our way is a holy man of God.
###### v10
Let us make a small roof chamber with walls, and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp, so that he can stay there whenever he comes to us."
###### v11
One day when he came there, he went up to the chamber and lay down there.
###### v12
He said to his servant Gehazi, "Call the Shunammite woman." When he had called her, she stood before him.
###### v13
He said to him, "Say to her, Since you have taken all this trouble for us, what may be done for you? Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?" She answered, "I live among my own people."
###### v14
He said, "What then may be done for her?" Gehazi answered, "Well, she has no son, and her husband is old."
###### v15
He said, "Call her." When he had called her, she stood at the door.
###### v16
He said, "At this season, in due time, you shall embrace a son." She replied, "No, my lord, O man of God; do not deceive your servant."
###### v17
The woman conceived and bore a son at that season, in due time, as Elisha had declared to her.
###### v18
When the child was older, he went out one day to his father among the reapers.
###### v19
He complained to his father, "Oh, my head, my head!" The father said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother."
###### v20
He carried him and brought him to his mother; the child sat on her lap until noon, and he died.
###### v21
She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, closed the door on him, and left.
###### v22
Then she called to her husband, and said, "Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so that I may quickly go to the man of God and come back again."
###### v23
He said, "Why go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath." She said, "It will be all right."
###### v24
Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, "Urge the animal on; do not hold back for me unless I tell you."
###### v25
So she set out, and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her coming, he said to Gehazi his servant, "Look, there is the Shunammite woman;
###### v26
run at once to meet her, and say to her, Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the child all right?" She answered, "It is all right."
###### v27
When she came to the man of God at the mountain, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi approached to push her away. But the man of God said, "Let her alone, for she is in bitter distress; the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me."
###### v28
Then she said, "Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, Do not mislead me?"
###### v29
He said to Gehazi, "Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, give no greeting, and if anyone greets you, do not answer; and lay my staff on the face of the child."
###### v30
Then the mother of the child said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave without you." So he rose up and followed her.
###### v31
Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the face of the child, but there was no sound or sign of life. He came back to meet him and told him, "The child has not awakened."
###### v32
When Elisha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on his bed.
###### v33
So he went in and closed the door on the two of them, and prayed to the LORD.
###### v34
Then he got up on the bed and lay upon the child, putting his mouth upon his mouth, his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and while he lay bent over him, the flesh of the child became warm.
###### v35
He got down, walked once to and fro in the room, then got up again and bent over him; the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
###### v36
Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, "Call the Shunammite woman." So he called her. When she came to him, he said, "Take your son."
###### v37
She came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground; then she took her son and left.
###### v38
When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As the company of prophets was sitting before him, he said to his servant, "Put the large pot on, and make some stew for the company of prophets."
###### v39
One of them went out into the field to gather herbs; he found a wild vine and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew, not knowing what they were.
###### v40
They served some for the men to eat. But while they were eating the stew, they cried out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" They could not eat it.
###### v41
He said, "Then bring some flour." He threw it into the pot, and said, "Serve the people and let them eat." And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
###### v42
A man came from Baal-shalishah, bringing food from the first fruits to the man of God: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. Elisha said, "Give it to the people and let them eat."
###### v43
But his servant said, "How can I set this before a hundred people?" So he repeated, "Give it to the people and let them eat, for thus says the LORD, 'They shall eat and have some left.'"
###### v44
He set it before them, they ate, and had some left, according to the word of the LORD.
