###### v1
Set the trumpet to your lips! One like a vulture is over the house of the LORD, because they have broken my covenant, and transgressed my law.
###### v2
Israel cries to me, "My God, we-- Israel-- know you!"
###### v3
Israel has spurned the good; the enemy shall pursue him.
###### v4
They made kings, but not through me; they set up princes, but without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they made idols for their own destruction.
###### v5
Your calf is rejected, O Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence?
###### v6
For it is from Israel, an artisan made it; it is not God. The calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces.
###### v7
For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads, it shall yield no meal; if it were to yield, foreigners would devour it.
###### v8
Israel is swallowed up; now they are among the nations as a useless vessel.
###### v9
For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass wandering alone; Ephraim has bargained for lovers.
###### v10
Though they bargain with the nations, I will now gather them up. They shall soon writhe under the burden of kings and princes.
###### v11
When Ephraim multiplied altars to expiate sin, they became to him altars for sinning.
###### v12
Though I write for him the multitude of my instructions, they are regarded as a strange thing.
###### v13
Though they offer choice sacrifices, though they eat flesh, the LORD does not accept them. Now he will remember their iniquity, and punish their sins; they shall return to Egypt.
###### v14
Israel has forgotten his Maker, and built palaces; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour his strongholds.
