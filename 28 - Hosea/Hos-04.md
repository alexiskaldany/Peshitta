###### v1
Hear the word of the LORD, O people of Israel; for the LORD has an indictment against the inhabitants of the land. There is no faithfulness or loyalty, and no knowledge of God in the land.
###### v2
Swearing, lying, and murder, and stealing and adultery break out; bloodshed follows bloodshed.
###### v3
Therefore the land mourns, and all who live in it languish; together with the wild animals and the birds of the air, even the fish of the sea are perishing.
###### v4
Yet let no one contend, and let none accuse, for with you is my contention, O priest.
###### v5
You shall stumble by day; the prophet also shall stumble with you by night, and I will destroy your mother.
###### v6
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.
###### v7
The more they increased, the more they sinned against me; they changed their glory into shame.
###### v8
They feed on the sin of my people; they are greedy for their iniquity.
###### v9
And it shall be like people, like priest; I will punish them for their ways, and repay them for their deeds.
###### v10
They shall eat, but not be satisfied; they shall play the whore, but not multiply; because they have forsaken the LORD to devote themselves to
###### v11
whoredom. Wine and new wine take away the understanding.
###### v12
My people consult a piece of wood, and their divining rod gives them oracles. For a spirit of whoredom has led them astray, and they have played the whore, forsaking their God.
###### v13
They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and make offerings upon the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is good. Therefore your daughters play the whore, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
###### v14
I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; for the men themselves go aside with whores, and sacrifice with temple prostitutes; thus a people without understanding comes to ruin.
###### v15
Though you play the whore, O Israel, do not let Judah become guilty. Do not enter into Gilgal, or go up to Beth-aven, and do not swear, "As the LORD lives."
###### v16
Like a stubborn heifer, Israel is stubborn; can the LORD now feed them like a lamb in a broad pasture?
###### v17
Ephraim is joined to idols-- let him alone.
###### v18
When their drinking is ended, they indulge in sexual orgies; they love lewdness more than their glory.
###### v19
A wind has wrapped them in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their altars.
