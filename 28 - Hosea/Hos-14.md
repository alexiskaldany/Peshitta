###### v1
Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, for you have stumbled because of your iniquity.
###### v2
Take words with you and return to the LORD; say to him, "Take away all guilt; accept that which is good, and we will offer the fruit of our lips.
###### v3
Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; we will say no more, 'Our God,' to the work of our hands. In you the orphan finds mercy."
###### v4
I will heal their disloyalty; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them.
###### v5
I will be like the dew to Israel; he shall blossom like the lily, he shall strike root like the forests of Lebanon.
###### v6
His shoots shall spread out; his beauty shall be like the olive tree, and his fragrance like that of Lebanon.
###### v7
They shall again live beneath my shadow, they shall flourish as a garden; they shall blossom like the vine, their fragrance shall be like the wine of Lebanon.
###### v8
O Ephraim, what have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like an evergreen cypress; your faithfulness comes from me.
###### v9
Those who are wise understand these things; those who are discerning know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, and the upright walk in them, but transgressors stumble in them.
