###### v1
Job again took up his discourse and said:
###### v2
"As God lives, who has taken away my right, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,
###### v3
as long as my breath is in me and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,
###### v4
my lips will not speak falsehood, and my tongue will not utter deceit.
###### v5
Far be it from me to say that you are right; until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
###### v6
I hold fast my righteousness, and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days.
###### v7
"May my enemy be like the wicked, and may my opponent be like the unrighteous.
###### v8
For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts them off, when God takes away their lives?
###### v9
Will God hear their cry when trouble comes upon them?
###### v10
Will they take delight in the Almighty? Will they call upon God at all times?
###### v11
I will teach you concerning the hand of God; that which is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
###### v12
All of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?
###### v13
"This is the portion of the wicked with God, and the heritage that oppressors receive from the Almighty:
###### v14
If their children are multiplied, it is for the sword; and their offspring have not enough to eat.
###### v15
Those who survive them the pestilence buries, and their widows make no lamentation.
###### v16
Though they heap up silver like dust, and pile up clothing like clay--
###### v17
they may pile it up, but the just will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver.
###### v18
They build their houses like nests, like booths made by sentinels of the vineyard.
###### v19
They go to bed with wealth, but will do so no more; they open their eyes, and it is gone.
###### v20
Terrors overtake them like a flood; in the night a whirlwind carries them off.
###### v21
The east wind lifts them up and they are gone; it sweeps them out of their place.
###### v22
It hurls at them without pity; they flee from its power in headlong flight.
###### v23
It claps its hands at them, and hisses at them from its place.
