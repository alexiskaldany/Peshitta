###### v1
After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
###### v2
Job said:
###### v3
"Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man-child is conceived.'
###### v4
Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, or light shine on it.
###### v5
Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds settle upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
###### v6
That night-- let thick darkness seize it! let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
###### v7
Yes, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry be heard in it.
###### v8
Let those curse it who curse the Sea, those who are skilled to rouse up Leviathan.
###### v9
Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none; may it not see the eyelids of the morning--
###### v10
because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, and hide trouble from my eyes.
###### v11
"Why did I not die at birth, come forth from the womb and expire?
###### v12
Why were there knees to receive me, or breasts for me to suck?
###### v13
Now I would be lying down and quiet; I would be asleep; then I would be at rest
###### v14
with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuild ruins for themselves,
###### v15
or with princes who have gold, who fill their houses with silver.
###### v16
Or why was I not buried like a stillborn child, like an infant that never sees the light?
###### v17
There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.
###### v18
There the prisoners are at ease together; they do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.
###### v19
The small and the great are there, and the slaves are free from their masters.
###### v20
"Why is light given to one in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,
###### v21
who long for death, but it does not come, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures;
###### v22
who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they find the grave?
###### v23
Why is light given to one who cannot see the way, whom God has fenced in?
###### v24
For my sighing comes like my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.
###### v25
Truly the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.
###### v26
I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest; but trouble comes."
