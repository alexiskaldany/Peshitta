###### v1
Then Job answered:
###### v2
"Today also my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy despite my groaning.
###### v3
Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his dwelling!
###### v4
I would lay my case before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
###### v5
I would learn what he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.
###### v6
Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; but he would give heed to me.
###### v7
There an upright person could reason with him, and I should be acquitted forever by my judge.
###### v8
"If I go forward, he is not there; or backward, I cannot perceive him;
###### v9
on the left he hides, and I cannot behold him; I turn to the right, but I cannot see him.
###### v10
But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I shall come out like gold.
###### v11
My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside.
###### v12
I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured in my bosom the words of his mouth.
###### v13
But he stands alone and who can dissuade him? What he desires, that he does.
###### v14
For he will complete what he appoints for me; and many such things are in his mind.
###### v15
Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him.
###### v16
God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;
###### v17
If only I could vanish in darkness, and thick darkness would cover my face!
