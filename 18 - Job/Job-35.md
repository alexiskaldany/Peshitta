###### v1
Elihu continued and said:
###### v2
"Do you think this to be just? You say, 'I am in the right before God.'
###### v3
If you ask, 'What advantage have I? How am I better off than if I had sinned?'
###### v4
I will answer you and your friends with you.
###### v5
Look at the heavens and see; observe the clouds, which are higher than you.
###### v6
If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
###### v7
If you are righteous, what do you give to him; or what does he receive from your hand?
###### v8
Your wickedness affects others like you, and your righteousness, other human beings.
###### v9
"Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out; they call for help because of the arm of the mighty.
###### v10
But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives strength in the night,
###### v11
who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?'
###### v12
There they cry out, but he does not answer, because of the pride of evildoers.
###### v13
Surely God does not hear an empty cry, nor does the Almighty regard it.
###### v14
How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him!
###### v15
And now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not greatly heed transgression,
###### v16
Job opens his mouth in empty talk, he multiplies words without knowledge."
