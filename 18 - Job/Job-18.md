###### v1
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
###### v2
"How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and then we shall speak.
###### v3
Why are we counted as cattle? Why are we stupid in your sight?
###### v4
You who tear yourself in your anger-- shall the earth be forsaken because of you, or the rock be removed out of its place?
###### v5
"Surely the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of their fire does not shine.
###### v6
The light is dark in their tent, and the lamp above them is put out.
###### v7
Their strong steps are shortened, and their own schemes throw them down.
###### v8
For they are thrust into a net by their own feet, and they walk into a pitfall.
###### v9
A trap seizes them by the heel; a snare lays hold of them.
###### v10
A rope is hid for them in the ground, a trap for them in the path.
###### v11
Terrors frighten them on every side, and chase them at their heels.
###### v12
Their strength is consumed by hunger, and calamity is ready for their stumbling.
###### v13
By disease their skin is consumed, the firstborn of Death consumes their limbs.
###### v14
They are torn from the tent in which they trusted, and are brought to the king of terrors.
###### v15
In their tents nothing remains; sulfur is scattered upon their habitations.
###### v16
Their roots dry up beneath, and their branches wither above.
###### v17
Their memory perishes from the earth, and they have no name in the street.
###### v18
They are thrust from light into darkness, and driven out of the world.
###### v19
They have no offspring or descendant among their people, and no survivor where they used to live.
###### v20
They of the west are appalled at their fate, and horror seizes those of the east.
###### v21
Surely such are the dwellings of the ungodly, such is the place of those who do not know God."
