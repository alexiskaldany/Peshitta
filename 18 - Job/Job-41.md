###### v1
"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook, or press down its tongue with a cord?
###### v2
Can you put a rope in its nose, or pierce its jaw with a hook?
###### v3
Will it make many supplications to you? Will it speak soft words to you?
###### v4
Will it make a covenant with you to be taken as your servant forever?
###### v5
Will you play with it as with a bird, or will you put it on leash for your girls?
###### v6
Will traders bargain over it? Will they divide it up among the merchants?
###### v7
Can you fill its skin with harpoons, or its head with fishing spears?
###### v8
Lay hands on it; think of the battle; you will not do it again!
###### v9
Any hope of capturing it will be disappointed; were not even the gods overwhelmed at the sight of it?
###### v10
No one is so fierce as to dare to stir it up. Who can stand before it?
###### v11
Who can confront it and be safe?-- under the whole heaven, who?
###### v12
"I will not keep silence concerning its limbs, or its mighty strength, or its splendid frame.
###### v13
Who can strip off its outer garment? Who can penetrate its double coat of mail?
###### v14
Who can open the doors of its face? There is terror all around its teeth.
###### v15
Its back is made of shields in rows, shut up closely as with a seal.
###### v16
One is so near to another that no air can come between them.
###### v17
They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated.
###### v18
Its sneezes flash forth light, and its eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.
###### v19
From its mouth go flaming torches; sparks of fire leap out.
###### v20
Out of its nostrils comes smoke, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.
###### v21
Its breath kindles coals, and a flame comes out of its mouth.
###### v22
In its neck abides strength, and terror dances before it.
###### v23
The folds of its flesh cling together; it is firmly cast and immovable.
###### v24
Its heart is as hard as stone, as hard as the lower millstone.
###### v25
When it raises itself up the gods are afraid; at the crashing they are beside themselves.
###### v26
Though the sword reaches it, it does not avail, nor does the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
###### v27
It counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.
###### v28
The arrow cannot make it flee; slingstones, for it, are turned to chaff.
###### v29
Clubs are counted as chaff; it laughs at the rattle of javelins.
###### v30
Its underparts are like sharp potsherds; it spreads itself like a threshing sledge on the mire.
###### v31
It makes the deep boil like a pot; it makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
###### v32
It leaves a shining wake behind it; one would think the deep to be white-haired.
###### v33
On earth it has no equal, a creature without fear.
###### v34
It surveys everything that is lofty; it is king over all that are proud."
