###### v1
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
###### v2
"Pay attention! My thoughts urge me to answer, because of the agitation within me.
###### v3
I hear censure that insults me, and a spirit beyond my understanding answers me.
###### v4
Do you not know this from of old, ever since mortals were placed on earth,
###### v5
that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless is but for a moment?
###### v6
Even though they mount up high as the heavens, and their head reaches to the clouds,
###### v7
they will perish forever like their own dung; those who have seen them will say, 'Where are they?'
###### v8
They will fly away like a dream, and not be found; they will be chased away like a vision of the night.
###### v9
The eye that saw them will see them no more, nor will their place behold them any longer.
###### v10
Their children will seek the favor of the poor, and their hands will give back their wealth.
###### v11
Their bodies, once full of youth, will lie down in the dust with them.
###### v12
"Though wickedness is sweet in their mouth, though they hide it under their tongues,
###### v13
though they are loath to let it go, and hold it in their mouths,
###### v14
yet their food is turned in their stomachs; it is the venom of asps within them.
###### v15
They swallow down riches and vomit them up again; God casts them out of their bellies.
###### v16
They will suck the poison of asps; the tongue of a viper will kill them.
###### v17
They will not look on the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds.
###### v18
They will give back the fruit of their toil, and will not swallow it down; from the profit of their trading they will get no enjoyment.
###### v19
For they have crushed and abandoned the poor, they have seized a house that they did not build.
###### v20
"They knew no quiet in their bellies; in their greed they let nothing escape.
###### v21
There was nothing left after they had eaten; therefore their prosperity will not endure.
###### v22
In full sufficiency they will be in distress; all the force of misery will come upon them.
###### v23
To fill their belly to the full God will send his fierce anger into them, and rain it upon them as their food.
###### v24
They will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike them through.
###### v25
It is drawn forth and comes out of their body, and the glittering point comes out of their gall; terrors come upon them.
###### v26
Utter darkness is laid up for their treasures; a fire fanned by no one will devour them; what is left in their tent will be consumed.
###### v27
The heavens will reveal their iniquity, and the earth will rise up against them.
###### v28
The possessions of their house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God's wrath.
###### v29
This is the portion of the wicked from God, the heritage decreed for them by God."
