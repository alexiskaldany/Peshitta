###### v1
Then Job answered:
###### v2
"I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all.
###### v3
Have windy words no limit? Or what provokes you that you keep on talking?
###### v4
I also could talk as you do, if you were in my place; I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you.
###### v5
I could encourage you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain.
###### v6
"If I speak, my pain is not assuaged, and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me?
###### v7
Surely now God has worn me out; he has made desolate all my company.
###### v8
And he has shriveled me up, which is a witness against me; my leanness has risen up against me, and it testifies to my face.
###### v9
He has torn me in his wrath, and hated me; he has gnashed his teeth at me; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me.
###### v10
They have gaped at me with their mouths; they have struck me insolently on the cheek; they mass themselves together against me.
###### v11
God gives me up to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands of the wicked.
###### v12
I was at ease, and he broke me in two; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target;
###### v13
his archers surround me. He slashes open my kidneys, and shows no mercy; he pours out my gall on the ground.
###### v14
He bursts upon me again and again; he rushes at me like a warrior.
###### v15
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my strength in the dust.
###### v16
My face is red with weeping, and deep darkness is on my eyelids,
###### v17
though there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.
###### v18
"O earth, do not cover my blood; let my outcry find no resting place.
###### v19
Even now, in fact, my witness is in heaven, and he that vouches for me is on high.
###### v20
My friends scorn me; my eye pours out tears to God,
###### v21
that he would maintain the right of a mortal with God, as one does for a neighbor.
###### v22
For when a few years have come, I shall go the way from which I shall not return.
