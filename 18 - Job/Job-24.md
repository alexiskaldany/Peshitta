***

###### v1
"Why are times not kept by the Almighty, and why do those who know him never see his days?
###### v2
The wicked remove landmarks; they seize flocks and pasture them.
###### v3
They drive away the donkey of the orphan; they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
###### v4
They thrust the needy off the road; the poor of the earth all hide themselves.
###### v5
Like wild asses in the desert they go out to their toil, scavenging in the wasteland food for their young.
###### v6
They reap in a field not their own and they glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
###### v7
They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.
###### v8
They are wet with the rain of the mountains, and cling to the rock for want of shelter.
###### v9
"There are those who snatch the orphan child from the breast, and take as a pledge the infant of the poor.
###### v10
They go about naked, without clothing; though hungry, they carry the sheaves;
###### v11
between their terraces they press out oil; they tread the wine presses, but suffer thirst.
###### v12
From the city the dying groan, and the throat of the wounded cries for help; yet God pays no attention to their prayer.
###### v13
"There are those who rebel against the light, who are not acquainted with its ways, and do not stay in its paths.
###### v14
The murderer rises at dusk to kill the poor and needy, and in the night is like a thief.
###### v15
The eye of the adulterer also waits for the twilight, saying, 'No eye will see me'; and he disguises his face.
###### v16
In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the light.
###### v17
For deep darkness is morning to all of them; for they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness.
###### v18
"Swift are they on the face of the waters; their portion in the land is cursed; no treader turns toward their vineyards.
###### v19
Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters; so does Sheol those who have sinned.
###### v20
The womb forgets them; the worm finds them sweet; they are no longer remembered; so wickedness is broken like a tree.
###### v21
"They harm the childless woman, and do no good to the widow.
###### v22
Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power; they rise up when they despair of life.
###### v23
He gives them security, and they are supported; his eyes are upon their ways.
###### v24
They are exalted a little while, and then are gone; they wither and fade like the mallow; they are cut off like the heads of grain.
###### v25
If it is not so, who will prove me a liar, and show that there is nothing in what I say?"
