###### v1
"Look, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.
###### v2
What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
###### v3
But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God.
###### v4
As for you, you whitewash with lies; all of you are worthless physicians.
###### v5
If you would only keep silent, that would be your wisdom!
###### v6
Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips.
###### v7
Will you speak falsely for God, and speak deceitfully for him?
###### v8
Will you show partiality toward him, will you plead the case for God?
###### v9
Will it be well with you when he searches you out? Or can you deceive him, as one person deceives another?
###### v10
He will surely rebuke you if in secret you show partiality.
###### v11
Will not his majesty terrify you, and the dread of him fall upon you?
###### v12
Your maxims are proverbs of ashes, your defenses are defenses of clay.
###### v13
"Let me have silence, and I will speak, and let come on me what may.
###### v14
I will take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand.
###### v15
See, he will kill me; I have no hope; but I will defend my ways to his face.
###### v16
This will be my salvation, that the godless shall not come before him.
###### v17
Listen carefully to my words, and let my declaration be in your ears.
###### v18
I have indeed prepared my case; I know that I shall be vindicated.
###### v19
Who is there that will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die.
###### v20
Only grant two things to me, then I will not hide myself from your face:
###### v21
withdraw your hand far from me, and do not let dread of you terrify me.
###### v22
Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you reply to me.
###### v23
How many are my iniquities and my sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin.
###### v24
Why do you hide your face, and count me as your enemy?
###### v25
Will you frighten a windblown leaf and pursue dry chaff?
###### v26
For you write bitter things against me, and make me reap the iniquities of my youth.
###### v27
You put my feet in the stocks, and watch all my paths; you set a bound to the soles of my feet.
###### v28
One wastes away like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
