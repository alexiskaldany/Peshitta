###### v1
"Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
###### v2
Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple.
###### v3
I have seen fools taking root, but suddenly I cursed their dwelling.
###### v4
Their children are far from safety, they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them.
###### v5
The hungry eat their harvest, and they take it even out of the thorns; and the thirsty pant after their wealth.
###### v6
For misery does not come from the earth, nor does trouble sprout from the ground;
###### v7
but human beings are born to trouble just as sparks fly upward.
###### v8
"As for me, I would seek God, and to God I would commit my cause.
###### v9
He does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number.
###### v10
He gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields;
###### v11
he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
###### v12
He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
###### v13
He takes the wise in their own craftiness; and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end.
###### v14
They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday as in the night.
###### v15
But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth, from the hand of the mighty.
###### v16
So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.
###### v17
"How happy is the one whom God reproves; therefore do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
###### v18
For he wounds, but he binds up; he strikes, but his hands heal.
###### v19
He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no harm shall touch you.
###### v20
In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.
###### v21
You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes.
###### v22
At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the wild animals of the earth.
###### v23
For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the wild animals shall be at peace with you.
###### v24
You shall know that your tent is safe, you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing.
###### v25
You shall know that your descendants will be many, and your offspring like the grass of the earth.
###### v26
You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, as a shock of grain comes up to the threshing floor in its season.
###### v27
See, we have searched this out; it is true. Hear, and know it for yourself."
