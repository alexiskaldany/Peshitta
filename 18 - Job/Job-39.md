###### v1
"Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the deer?
###### v2
Can you number the months that they fulfill, and do you know the time when they give birth,
###### v3
when they crouch to give birth to their offspring, and are delivered of their young?
###### v4
Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open; they go forth, and do not return to them.
###### v5
"Who has let the wild ass go free? Who has loosed the bonds of the swift ass,
###### v6
to which I have given the steppe for its home, the salt land for its dwelling place?
###### v7
It scorns the tumult of the city; it does not hear the shouts of the driver.
###### v8
It ranges the mountains as its pasture, and it searches after every green thing.
###### v9
"Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will it spend the night at your crib?
###### v10
Can you tie it in the furrow with ropes, or will it harrow the valleys after you?
###### v11
Will you depend on it because its strength is great, and will you hand over your labor to it?
###### v12
Do you have faith in it that it will return, and bring your grain to your threshing floor?
###### v13
"The ostrich's wings flap wildly, though its pinions lack plumage.
###### v14
For it leaves its eggs to the earth, and lets them be warmed on the ground,
###### v15
forgetting that a foot may crush them, and that a wild animal may trample them.
###### v16
It deals cruelly with its young, as if they were not its own; though its labor should be in vain, yet it has no fear;
###### v17
because God has made it forget wisdom, and given it no share in understanding.
###### v18
When it spreads its plumes aloft, it laughs at the horse and its rider.
###### v19
"Do you give the horse its might? Do you clothe its neck with mane?
###### v20
Do you make it leap like the locust? Its majestic snorting is terrible.
###### v21
It paws violently, exults mightily; it goes out to meet the weapons.
###### v22
It laughs at fear, and is not dismayed; it does not turn back from the sword.
###### v23
Upon it rattle the quiver, the flashing spear, and the javelin.
###### v24
With fierceness and rage it swallows the ground; it cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
###### v25
When the trumpet sounds, it says 'Aha!' From a distance it smells the battle, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
###### v26
"Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and spreads its wings toward the south?
###### v27
Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes its nest on high?
###### v28
It lives on the rock and makes its home in the fastness of the rocky crag.
###### v29
From there it spies the prey; its eyes see it from far away.
###### v30
Its young ones suck up blood; and where the slain are, there it is."
