###### v1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
###### v2
"Should the wise answer with windy knowledge, and fill themselves with the east wind?
###### v3
Should they argue in unprofitable talk, or in words with which they can do no good?
###### v4
But you are doing away with the fear of God, and hindering meditation before God.
###### v5
For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.
###### v6
Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; your own lips testify against you.
###### v7
"Are you the firstborn of the human race? Were you brought forth before the hills?
###### v8
Have you listened in the council of God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?
###### v9
What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not clear to us?
###### v10
The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, those older than your father.
###### v11
Are the consolations of God too small for you, or the word that deals gently with you?
###### v12
Why does your heart carry you away, and why do your eyes flash,
###### v13
so that you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?
###### v14
What are mortals, that they can be clean? Or those born of woman, that they can be righteous?
###### v15
God puts no trust even in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his sight;
###### v16
how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, one who drinks iniquity like water!
###### v17
"I will show you; listen to me; what I have seen I will declare--
###### v18
what sages have told, and their ancestors have not hidden,
###### v19
to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them.
###### v20
The wicked writhe in pain all their days, through all the years that are laid up for the ruthless.
###### v21
Terrifying sounds are in their ears; in prosperity the destroyer will come upon them.
###### v22
They despair of returning from darkness, and they are destined for the sword.
###### v23
They wander abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?' They know that a day of darkness is ready at hand;
###### v24
distress and anguish terrify them; they prevail against them, like a king prepared for battle.
###### v25
Because they stretched out their hands against God, and bid defiance to the Almighty,
###### v26
running stubbornly against him with a thick-bossed shield;
###### v27
because they have covered their faces with their fat, and gathered fat upon their loins,
###### v28
they will live in desolate cities, in houses that no one should inhabit, houses destined to become heaps of ruins;
###### v29
they will not be rich, and their wealth will not endure, nor will they strike root in the earth;
###### v30
they will not escape from darkness; the flame will dry up their shoots, and their blossom will be swept away by the wind.
###### v31
Let them not trust in emptiness, deceiving themselves; for emptiness will be their recompense.
###### v32
It will be paid in full before their time, and their branch will not be green.
###### v33
They will shake off their unripe grape, like the vine, and cast off their blossoms, like the olive tree.
###### v34
For the company of the godless is barren, and fire consumes the tents of bribery.
###### v35
They conceive mischief and bring forth evil and their heart prepares deceit."
