###### v1
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
###### v2
"Dominion and fear are with God; he makes peace in his high heaven.
###### v3
Is there any number to his armies? Upon whom does his light not arise?
###### v4
How then can a mortal be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
###### v5
If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his sight,
###### v6
how much less a mortal, who is a maggot, and a human being, who is a worm!"
