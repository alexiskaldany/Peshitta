###### v1
Then Elihu continued and said:
###### v2
"Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who know;
###### v3
for the ear tests words as the palate tastes food.
###### v4
Let us choose what is right; let us determine among ourselves what is good.
###### v5
For Job has said, 'I am innocent, and God has taken away my right;
###### v6
in spite of being right I am counted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.'
###### v7
Who is there like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water,
###### v8
who goes in company with evildoers and walks with the wicked?
###### v9
For he has said, 'It profits one nothing to take delight in God.'
###### v10
"Therefore, hear me, you who have sense, far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong.
###### v11
For according to their deeds he will repay them, and according to their ways he will make it befall them.
###### v12
Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice.
###### v13
Who gave him charge over the earth and who laid on him the whole world?
###### v14
If he should take back his spirit to himself, and gather to himself his breath,
###### v15
all flesh would perish together, and all mortals return to dust.
###### v16
"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.
###### v17
Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn one who is righteous and mighty,
###### v18
who says to a king, 'You scoundrel!' and to princes, 'You wicked men!';
###### v19
who shows no partiality to nobles, nor regards the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?
###### v20
In a moment they die; at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no human hand.
###### v21
"For his eyes are upon the ways of mortals, and he sees all their steps.
###### v22
There is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers may hide themselves.
###### v23
For he has not appointed a time for anyone to go before God in judgment.
###### v24
He shatters the mighty without investigation, and sets others in their place.
###### v25
Thus, knowing their works, he overturns them in the night, and they are crushed.
###### v26
He strikes them for their wickedness while others look on,
###### v27
because they turned aside from following him, and had no regard for any of his ways,
###### v28
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted--
###### v29
When he is quiet, who can condemn? When he hides his face, who can behold him, whether it be a nation or an individual?--
###### v30
so that the godless should not reign, or those who ensnare the people.
###### v31
"For has anyone said to God, 'I have endured punishment; I will not offend any more;
###### v32
teach me what I do not see; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'?
###### v33
Will he then pay back to suit you, because you reject it? For you must choose, and not I; therefore declare what you know.
###### v34
Those who have sense will say to me, and the wise who hear me will say,
###### v35
'Job speaks without knowledge, his words are without insight.'
###### v36
Would that Job were tried to the limit, because his answers are those of the wicked.
###### v37
For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God."
