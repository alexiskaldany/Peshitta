###### v1
"But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words.
###### v2
See, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks.
###### v3
My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely.
###### v4
The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
###### v5
Answer me, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand.
###### v6
See, before God I am as you are; I too was formed from a piece of clay.
###### v7
No fear of me need terrify you; my pressure will not be heavy on you.
###### v8
"Surely, you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the sound of your words.
###### v9
You say, 'I am clean, without transgression; I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me.
###### v10
Look, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy;
###### v11
he puts my feet in the stocks, and watches all my paths.'
###### v12
"But in this you are not right. I will answer you: God is greater than any mortal.
###### v13
Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of my words'?
###### v14
For God speaks in one way, and in two, though people do not perceive it.
###### v15
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on mortals, while they slumber on their beds,
###### v16
then he opens their ears, and terrifies them with warnings,
###### v17
that he may turn them aside from their deeds, and keep them from pride,
###### v18
to spare their souls from the Pit, their lives from traversing the River.
###### v19
They are also chastened with pain upon their beds, and with continual strife in their bones,
###### v20
so that their lives loathe bread, and their appetites dainty food.
###### v21
Their flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen; and their bones, once invisible, now stick out.
###### v22
Their souls draw near the Pit, and their lives to those who bring death.
###### v23
Then, if there should be for one of them an angel, a mediator, one of a thousand, one who declares a person upright,
###### v24
and he is gracious to that person, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the Pit; I have found a ransom;
###### v25
let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.'
###### v26
Then he prays to God, and is accepted by him, he comes into his presence with joy, and God repays him for his righteousness.
###### v27
That person sings to others and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, and it was not paid back to me.
###### v28
He has redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and my life shall see the light.'
###### v29
"God indeed does all these things, twice, three times, with mortals,
###### v30
to bring back their souls from the Pit, so that they may see the light of life.
###### v31
Pay heed, Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
###### v32
If you have anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.
###### v33
If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
