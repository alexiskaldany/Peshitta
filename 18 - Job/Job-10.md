***

###### v1
"I loathe my life; I will give free utterance to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
###### v2
I will say to God, Do not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me.
###### v3
Does it seem good to you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands and favor the schemes of the wicked?
###### v4
Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as humans see?
###### v5
Are your days like the days of mortals, or your years like human years,
###### v6
that you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin,
###### v7
although you know that I am not guilty, and there is no one to deliver out of your hand?
###### v8
Your hands fashioned and made me; and now you turn and destroy me.
###### v9
Remember that you fashioned me like clay; and will you turn me to dust again?
###### v10
Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese?
###### v11
You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.
###### v12
You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit.
###### v13
Yet these things you hid in your heart; I know that this was your purpose.
###### v14
If I sin, you watch me, and do not acquit me of my iniquity.
###### v15
If I am wicked, woe to me! If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look upon my affliction.
###### v16
Bold as a lion you hunt me; you repeat your exploits against me.
###### v17
You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your vexation toward me; you bring fresh troops against me.
###### v18
"Why did you bring me forth from the womb? Would that I had died before any eye had seen me,
###### v19
and were as though I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave.
###### v20
Are not the days of my life few? Let me alone, that I may find a little comfort
###### v21
before I go, never to return, to the land of gloom and deep darkness,
###### v22
the land of gloom and chaos, where light is like darkness."
