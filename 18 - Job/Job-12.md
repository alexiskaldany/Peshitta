###### v3
But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these?

The tents of robbers are at peace, and those who provoke God are secure, who bring their god in their hands.

With him are strength and wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are his.

###### v24
He strips understanding from the leaders of the earth, and makes them wander in a pathless waste.
###### v25
They grope in the dark without light; he makes them stagger like a drunkard.
