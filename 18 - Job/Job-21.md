###### v1
Then Job answered:
###### v2
"Listen carefully to my words, and let this be your consolation.
###### v3
Bear with me, and I will speak; then after I have spoken, mock on.
###### v4
As for me, is my complaint addressed to mortals? Why should I not be impatient?
###### v5
Look at me, and be appalled, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
###### v6
When I think of it I am dismayed, and shuddering seizes my flesh.
###### v7
Why do the wicked live on, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?
###### v8
Their children are established in their presence, and their offspring before their eyes.
###### v9
Their houses are safe from fear, and no rod of God is upon them.
###### v10
Their bull breeds without fail; their cow calves and never miscarries.
###### v11
They send out their little ones like a flock, and their children dance around.
###### v12
They sing to the tambourine and the lyre, and rejoice to the sound of the pipe.
###### v13
They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol.
###### v14
They say to God, 'Leave us alone! We do not desire to know your ways.
###### v15
What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit do we get if we pray to him?'
###### v16
Is not their prosperity indeed their own achievement? The plans of the wicked are repugnant to me.
###### v17
"How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? How often does calamity come upon them? How often does God distribute pains in his anger?
###### v18
How often are they like straw before the wind, and like chaff that the storm carries away?
###### v19
You say, 'God stores up their iniquity for their children.' Let it be paid back to them, so that they may know it.
###### v20
Let their own eyes see their destruction, and let them drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
###### v21
For what do they care for their household after them, when the number of their months is cut off?
###### v22
Will any teach God knowledge, seeing that he judges those that are on high?
###### v23
One dies in full prosperity, being wholly at ease and secure,
###### v24
his loins full of milk and the marrow of his bones moist.
###### v25
Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted of good.
###### v26
They lie down alike in the dust, and the worms cover them.
###### v27
"Oh, I know your thoughts, and your schemes to wrong me.
###### v28
For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?'
###### v29
Have you not asked those who travel the roads, and do you not accept their testimony,
###### v30
that the wicked are spared in the day of calamity, and are rescued in the day of wrath?
###### v31
Who declares their way to their face, and who repays them for what they have done?
###### v32
When they are carried to the grave, a watch is kept over their tomb.
###### v33
The clods of the valley are sweet to them; everyone will follow after, and those who went before are innumerable.
###### v34
How then will you comfort me with empty nothings? There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood."
