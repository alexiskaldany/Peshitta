###### v1
Job again took up his discourse and said:
###### v2
"Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me;
###### v3
when his lamp shone over my head, and by his light I walked through darkness;
###### v4
when I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent;
###### v5
when the Almighty was still with me, when my children were around me;
###### v6
when my steps were washed with milk, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
###### v7
When I went out to the gate of the city, when I took my seat in the square,
###### v8
the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose up and stood;
###### v9
the nobles refrained from talking, and laid their hands on their mouths;
###### v10
the voices of princes were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
###### v11
When the ear heard, it commended me, and when the eye saw, it approved;
###### v12
because I delivered the poor who cried, and the orphan who had no helper.
###### v13
The blessing of the wretched came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
###### v14
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.
###### v15
I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame.
###### v16
I was a father to the needy, and I championed the cause of the stranger.
###### v17
I broke the fangs of the unrighteous, and made them drop their prey from their teeth.
###### v18
Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days like the phoenix;
###### v19
my roots spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches;
###### v20
my glory was fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.'
###### v21
"They listened to me, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel.
###### v22
After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them like dew.
###### v23
They waited for me as for the rain; they opened their mouths as for the spring rain.
###### v24
I smiled on them when they had no confidence; and the light of my countenance they did not extinguish.
###### v25
I chose their way, and sat as chief, and I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners.
