###### v1
"I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I look upon a virgin?
###### v2
What would be my portion from God above, and my heritage from the Almighty on high?
###### v3
Does not calamity befall the unrighteous, and disaster the workers of iniquity?
###### v4
Does he not see my ways, and number all my steps?
###### v5
"If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit--
###### v6
let me be weighed in a just balance, and let God know my integrity!--
###### v7
if my step has turned aside from the way, and my heart has followed my eyes, and if any spot has clung to my hands;
###### v8
then let me sow, and another eat; and let what grows for me be rooted out.
###### v9
"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door;
###### v10
then let my wife grind for another, and let other men kneel over her.
###### v11
For that would be a heinous crime; that would be a criminal offense;
###### v12
for that would be a fire consuming down to Abaddon, and it would burn to the root all my harvest.
###### v13
"If I have rejected the cause of my male or female slaves, when they brought a complaint against me;
###### v14
what then shall I do when God rises up? When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him?
###### v15
Did not he who made me in the womb make them? And did not one fashion us in the womb?
###### v16
"If I have withheld anything that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
###### v17
or have eaten my morsel alone, and the orphan has not eaten from it--
###### v18
for from my youth I reared the orphan like a father, and from my mother's womb I guided the widow--
###### v19
if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or a poor person without covering,
###### v20
whose loins have not blessed me, and who was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
###### v21
if I have raised my hand against the orphan, because I saw I had supporters at the gate;
###### v22
then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken from its socket.
###### v23
For I was in terror of calamity from God, and I could not have faced his majesty.
###### v24
"If I have made gold my trust, or called fine gold my confidence;
###### v25
if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, or because my hand had gotten much;
###### v26
if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor,
###### v27
and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand;
###### v28
this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I should have been false to God above.
###### v29
"If I have rejoiced at the ruin of those who hated me, or exulted when evil overtook them--
###### v30
I have not let my mouth sin by asking for their lives with a curse--
###### v31
if those of my tent ever said, 'O that we might be sated with his flesh!'--
###### v32
the stranger has not lodged in the street; I have opened my doors to the traveler--
###### v33
if I have concealed my transgressions as others do, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
###### v34
because I stood in great fear of the multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors--
###### v35
Oh, that I had one to hear me! (Here is my signature! let the Almighty answer me!) Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary!
###### v36
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me like a crown;
###### v37
I would give him an account of all my steps; like a prince I would approach him.
###### v38
"If my land has cried out against me, and its furrows have wept together;
###### v39
if I have eaten its yield without payment, and caused the death of its owners;
###### v40
let thorns grow instead of wheat, and foul weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
