###### v1
Elihu continued and said:
###### v2
"Bear with me a little, and I will show you, for I have yet something to say on God's behalf.
###### v3
I will bring my knowledge from far away, and ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
###### v4
For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
###### v5
"Surely God is mighty and does not despise any; he is mighty in strength of understanding.
###### v6
He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives the afflicted their right.
###### v7
He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne he sets them forever, and they are exalted.
###### v8
And if they are bound in fetters and caught in the cords of affliction,
###### v9
then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly.
###### v10
He opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity.
###### v11
If they listen, and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasantness.
###### v12
But if they do not listen, they shall perish by the sword, and die without knowledge.
###### v13
"The godless in heart cherish anger; they do not cry for help when he binds them.
###### v14
They die in their youth, and their life ends in shame.
###### v15
He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens their ear by adversity.
###### v16
He also allured you out of distress into a broad place where there was no constraint, and what was set on your table was full of fatness.
###### v17
"But you are obsessed with the case of the wicked; judgment and justice seize you.
###### v18
Beware that wrath does not entice you into scoffing, and do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
###### v19
Will your cry avail to keep you from distress, or will all the force of your strength?
###### v20
Do not long for the night, when peoples are cut off in their place.
###### v21
Beware! Do not turn to iniquity; because of that you have been tried by affliction.
###### v22
See, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him?
###### v23
Who has prescribed for him his way, or who can say, 'You have done wrong'?
###### v24
"Remember to extol his work, of which mortals have sung.
###### v25
All people have looked on it; everyone watches it from far away.
###### v26
Surely God is great, and we do not know him; the number of his years is unsearchable.
###### v27
For he draws up the drops of water; he distills his mist in rain,
###### v28
which the skies pour down and drop upon mortals abundantly.
###### v29
Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?
###### v30
See, he scatters his lightning around him and covers the roots of the sea.
###### v31
For by these he governs peoples; he gives food in abundance.
###### v32
He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark.
###### v33
Its crashing tells about him; he is jealous with anger against iniquity.
