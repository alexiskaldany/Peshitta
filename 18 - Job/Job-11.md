###### v1
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
###### v2
"Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and should one full of talk be vindicated?
###### v3
Should your babble put others to silence, and when you mock, shall no one shame you?
###### v4
For you say, 'My conduct is pure, and I am clean in God's sight.'
###### v5
But oh, that God would speak, and open his lips to you,
###### v6
and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For wisdom is many-sided. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves.
###### v7
"Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?
###### v8
It is higher than heaven-- what can you do? Deeper than Sheol-- what can you know?
###### v9
Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
###### v10
If he passes through, and imprisons, and assembles for judgment, who can hinder him?
###### v11
For he knows those who are worthless; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it?
###### v12
But a stupid person will get understanding, when a wild ass is born human.
###### v13
"If you direct your heart rightly, you will stretch out your hands toward him.
###### v14
If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and do not let wickedness reside in your tents.
###### v15
Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure, and will not fear.
###### v16
You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away.
###### v17
And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.
###### v18
And you will have confidence, because there is hope; you will be protected and take your rest in safety.
###### v19
You will lie down, and no one will make you afraid; many will entreat your favor.
###### v20
But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last."
