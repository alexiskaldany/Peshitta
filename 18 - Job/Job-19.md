###### v1
Then Job answered:
###### v2
"How long will you torment me, and break me in pieces with words?
###### v3
These ten times you have cast reproach upon me; are you not ashamed to wrong me?
###### v4
And even if it is true that I have erred, my error remains with me.
###### v5
If indeed you magnify yourselves against me, and make my humiliation an argument against me,
###### v6
know then that God has put me in the wrong, and closed his net around me.
###### v7
Even when I cry out, 'Violence!' I am not answered; I call aloud, but there is no justice.
###### v8
He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness upon my paths.
###### v9
He has stripped my glory from me, and taken the crown from my head.
###### v10
He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone, he has uprooted my hope like a tree.
###### v11
He has kindled his wrath against me, and counts me as his adversary.
###### v12
His troops come on together; they have thrown up siegeworks against me, and encamp around my tent.
###### v13
"He has put my family far from me, and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.
###### v14
My relatives and my close friends have failed me;
###### v15
the guests in my house have forgotten me; my serving girls count me as a stranger; I have become an alien in their eyes.
###### v16
I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer; I must myself plead with him.
###### v17
My breath is repulsive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own family.
###### v18
Even young children despise me; when I rise, they talk against me.
###### v19
All my intimate friends abhor me, and those whom I loved have turned against me.
###### v20
My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
###### v21
Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me!
###### v22
Why do you, like God, pursue me, never satisfied with my flesh?
###### v23
"O that my words were written down! O that they were inscribed in a book!
###### v24
O that with an iron pen and with lead they were engraved on a rock forever!
###### v25
For I know that my Redeemer lives, and that at the last he will stand upon the earth;
###### v26
and after my skin has been thus destroyed, then in my flesh I shall see God,
###### v27
whom I shall see on my side, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. My heart faints within me!
###### v28
If you say, 'How we will persecute him!' and, 'The root of the matter is found in him';
###### v29
be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment."
