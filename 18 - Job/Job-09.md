###### v1
Then Job answered:
###### v2
"Indeed I know that this is so; but how can a mortal be just before God?
###### v3
If one wished to contend with him, one could not answer him once in a thousand.
###### v4
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength-- who has resisted him, and succeeded?--
###### v5
he who removes mountains, and they do not know it, when he overturns them in his anger;
###### v6
who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble;
###### v7
who commands the sun, and it does not rise; who seals up the stars;
###### v8
who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the Sea;
###### v9
who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the chambers of the south;
###### v10
who does great things beyond understanding, and marvelous things without number.
###### v11
Look, he passes by me, and I do not see him; he moves on, but I do not perceive him.
###### v12
He snatches away; who can stop him? Who will say to him, 'What are you doing?'
###### v13
"God will not turn back his anger; the helpers of Rahab bowed beneath him.
###### v14
How then can I answer him, choosing my words with him?
###### v15
Though I am innocent, I cannot answer him; I must appeal for mercy to my accuser.
###### v16
If I summoned him and he answered me, I do not believe that he would listen to my voice.
###### v17
For he crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause;
###### v18
he will not let me get my breath, but fills me with bitterness.
###### v19
If it is a contest of strength, he is the strong one! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him?
###### v20
Though I am innocent, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse.
###### v21
I am blameless; I do not know myself; I loathe my life.
###### v22
It is all one; therefore I say, he destroys both the blameless and the wicked.
###### v23
When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent.
###### v24
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the eyes of its judges-- if it is not he, who then is it?
###### v25
"My days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good.
###### v26
They go by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping on the prey.
###### v27
If I say, 'I will forget my complaint; I will put off my sad countenance and be of good cheer,'
###### v28
I become afraid of all my suffering, for I know you will not hold me innocent.
###### v29
I shall be condemned; why then do I labor in vain?
###### v30
If I wash myself with soap and cleanse my hands with lye,
###### v31
yet you will plunge me into filth, and my own clothes will abhor me.
###### v32
For he is not a mortal, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together.
###### v33
There is no umpire between us, who might lay his hand on us both.
###### v34
If he would take his rod away from me, and not let dread of him terrify me,
###### v35
then I would speak without fear of him, for I know I am not what I am thought to be.
