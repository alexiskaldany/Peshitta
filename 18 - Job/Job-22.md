###### v1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
###### v2
"Can a mortal be of use to God? Can even the wisest be of service to him?
###### v3
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous, or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless?
###### v4
Is it for your piety that he reproves you, and enters into judgment with you?
###### v5
Is not your wickedness great? There is no end to your iniquities.
###### v6
For you have exacted pledges from your family for no reason, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
###### v7
You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.
###### v8
The powerful possess the land, and the favored live in it.
###### v9
You have sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of the orphans you have crushed.
###### v10
Therefore snares are around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you,
###### v11
or darkness so that you cannot see; a flood of water covers you.
###### v12
"Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how lofty they are!
###### v13
Therefore you say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the deep darkness?
###### v14
Thick clouds enwrap him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the dome of heaven.'
###### v15
Will you keep to the old way that the wicked have trod?
###### v16
They were snatched away before their time; their foundation was washed away by a flood.
###### v17
They said to God, 'Leave us alone,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?'
###### v18
Yet he filled their houses with good things-- but the plans of the wicked are repugnant to me.
###### v19
The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent laugh them to scorn,
###### v20
saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left, the fire has consumed.'
###### v21
"Agree with God, and be at peace; in this way good will come to you.
###### v22
Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.
###### v23
If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored, if you remove unrighteousness from your tents,
###### v24
if you treat gold like dust, and gold of Ophir like the stones of the torrent-bed,
###### v25
and if the Almighty is your gold and your precious silver,
###### v26
then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and lift up your face to God.
###### v27
You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows.
###### v28
You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways.
###### v29
When others are humiliated, you say it is pride; for he saves the humble.
###### v30
He will deliver even those who are guilty; they will escape because of the cleanness of your hands."
