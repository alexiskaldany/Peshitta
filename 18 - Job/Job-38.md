###### v1
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind:
###### v2
"Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
###### v3
Gird up your loins like a man, I will question you, and you shall declare to me.
###### v4
"Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.
###### v5
Who determined its measurements-- surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?
###### v6
On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone
###### v7
when the morning stars sang together and all the heavenly beings shouted for joy?
###### v8
"Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb?--
###### v9
when I made the clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band,
###### v10
and prescribed bounds for it, and set bars and doors,
###### v11
and said, 'Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stopped'?
###### v12
"Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,
###### v13
so that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?
###### v14
It is changed like clay under the seal, and it is dyed like a garment.
###### v15
Light is withheld from the wicked, and their uplifted arm is broken.
###### v16
"Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep?
###### v17
Have the gates of death been revealed to you, or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
###### v18
Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth? Declare, if you know all this.
###### v19
"Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and where is the place of darkness,
###### v20
that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home?
###### v21
Surely you know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!
###### v22
"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
###### v23
which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?
###### v24
What is the way to the place where the light is distributed, or where the east wind is scattered upon the earth?
###### v25
"Who has cut a channel for the torrents of rain, and a way for the thunderbolt,
###### v26
to bring rain on a land where no one lives, on the desert, which is empty of human life,
###### v27
to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to make the ground put forth grass?
###### v28
"Has the rain a father, or who has begotten the drops of dew?
###### v29
From whose womb did the ice come forth, and who has given birth to the hoarfrost of heaven?
###### v30
The waters become hard like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
###### v31
"Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades, or loose the cords of Orion?
###### v32
Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season, or can you guide the Bear with its children?
###### v33
Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule on the earth?
###### v34
"Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that a flood of waters may cover you?
###### v35
Can you send forth lightnings, so that they may go and say to you, 'Here we are'?
###### v36
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts, or given understanding to the mind?
###### v37
Who has the wisdom to number the clouds? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,
###### v38
when the dust runs into a mass and the clods cling together?
###### v39
"Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
###### v40
when they crouch in their dens, or lie in wait in their covert?
###### v41
Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God, and wander about for lack of food?
