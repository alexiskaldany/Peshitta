###### v1
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
###### v2
Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God;
###### v3
he was angry also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, though they had declared Job to be in the wrong.
###### v4
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.
###### v5
But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry.
###### v6
Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answered: "I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.
###### v7
I said, 'Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.'
###### v8
But truly it is the spirit in a mortal, the breath of the Almighty, that makes for understanding.
###### v9
It is not the old that are wise, nor the aged that understand what is right.
###### v10
Therefore I say, 'Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.'
###### v11
"See, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say.
###### v12
I gave you my attention, but there was in fact no one that confuted Job, no one among you that answered his words.
###### v13
Yet do not say, 'We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a human.'
###### v14
He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches.
###### v15
"They are dismayed, they answer no more; they have not a word to say.
###### v16
And am I to wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more?
###### v17
I also will give my answer; I also will declare my opinion.
###### v18
For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.
###### v19
My heart is indeed like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins, it is ready to burst.
###### v20
I must speak, so that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.
###### v21
I will not show partiality to any person or use flattery toward anyone.
###### v22
For I do not know how to flatter-- or my Maker would soon put an end to me!
