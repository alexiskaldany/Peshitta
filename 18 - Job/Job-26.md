###### v1
Then Job answered:
###### v2
"How you have helped one who has no power! How you have assisted the arm that has no strength!
###### v3
How you have counseled one who has no wisdom, and given much good advice!
###### v4
With whose help have you uttered words, and whose spirit has come forth from you?
###### v5
The shades below tremble, the waters and their inhabitants.
###### v6
Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.
###### v7
He stretches out Zaphon over the void, and hangs the earth upon nothing.
###### v8
He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not torn open by them.
###### v9
He covers the face of the full moon, and spreads over it his cloud.
###### v10
He has described a circle on the face of the waters, at the boundary between light and darkness.
###### v11
The pillars of heaven tremble, and are astounded at his rebuke.
###### v12
By his power he stilled the Sea; by his understanding he struck down Rahab.
###### v13
By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
###### v14
These are indeed but the outskirts of his ways; and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"
