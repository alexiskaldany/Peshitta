###### v1
And the LORD said to Job:
###### v2
"Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Anyone who argues with God must respond."
###### v3
Then Job answered the LORD:
###### v4
"See, I am of small account; what shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.
###### v5
I have spoken once, and I will not answer; twice, but will proceed no further."
###### v6
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind:
###### v7
"Gird up your loins like a man; I will question you, and you declare to me.
###### v8
Will you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that you may be justified?
###### v9
Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his?
###### v10
"Deck yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendor.
###### v11
Pour out the overflowings of your anger, and look on all who are proud, and abase them.
###### v12
Look on all who are proud, and bring them low; tread down the wicked where they stand.
###### v13
Hide them all in the dust together; bind their faces in the world below.
###### v14
Then I will also acknowledge to you that your own right hand can give you victory.
###### v15
"Look at Behemoth, which I made just as I made you; it eats grass like an ox.
###### v16
Its strength is in its loins, and its power in the muscles of its belly.
###### v17
It makes its tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are knit together.
###### v18
Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like bars of iron.
###### v19
"It is the first of the great acts of God-- only its Maker can approach it with the sword.
###### v20
For the mountains yield food for it where all the wild animals play.
###### v21
Under the lotus plants it lies, in the covert of the reeds and in the marsh.
###### v22
The lotus trees cover it for shade; the willows of the wadi surround it.
###### v23
Even if the river is turbulent, it is not frightened; it is confident though Jordan rushes against its mouth.
###### v24
Can one take it with hooks or pierce its nose with a snare?
