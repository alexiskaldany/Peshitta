###### v1
Then Job answered:
###### v2
"O that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!
###### v3
For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.
###### v4
For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
###### v5
Does the wild ass bray over its grass, or the ox low over its fodder?
###### v6
Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any flavor in the juice of mallows?
###### v7
My appetite refuses to touch them; they are like food that is loathsome to me.
###### v8
"O that I might have my request, and that God would grant my desire;
###### v9
that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!
###### v10
This would be my consolation; I would even exult in unrelenting pain; for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
###### v11
What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?
###### v12
Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?
###### v13
In truth I have no help in me, and any resource is driven from me.
###### v14
"Those who withhold kindness from a friend forsake the fear of the Almighty.
###### v15
My companions are treacherous like a torrent-bed, like freshets that pass away,
###### v16
that run dark with ice, turbid with melting snow.
###### v17
In time of heat they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.
###### v18
The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste, and perish.
###### v19
The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope.
###### v20
They are disappointed because they were confident; they come there and are confounded.
###### v21
Such you have now become to me; you see my calamity, and are afraid.
###### v22
Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?
###### v23
Or, 'Save me from an opponent's hand'? Or, 'Ransom me from the hand of oppressors'?
###### v24
"Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone wrong.
###### v25
How forceful are honest words! But your reproof, what does it reprove?
###### v26
Do you think that you can reprove words, as if the speech of the desperate were wind?
###### v27
You would even cast lots over the orphan, and bargain over your friend.
###### v28
"But now, be pleased to look at me; for I will not lie to your face.
###### v29
Turn, I pray, let no wrong be done. Turn now, my vindication is at stake.
###### v30
Is there any wrong on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern calamity?
