###### v1
Then Job answered the LORD:
###### v2
"I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
###### v3
'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
###### v4
'Hear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you declare to me.'
###### v5
I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you;
###### v6
therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes."
###### v7
After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
###### v8
Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has done."
###### v9
So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.
###### v10
And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job when he had prayed for his friends; and the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
###### v11
Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him; and each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring.
###### v12
The LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand donkeys.
###### v13
He also had seven sons and three daughters.
###### v14
He named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.
###### v15
In all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters; and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers.
###### v16
After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children, and his children's children, four generations.
###### v17
And Job died, old and full of days.
