###### v1
Since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year, make perfect those who approach.
###### v2
Otherwise, would they not have ceased being offered, since the worshipers, cleansed once for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sin?
###### v3
But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year.
###### v4
For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
###### v5
Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me;
###### v6
in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.
###### v7
Then I said, 'See, God, I have come to do your will, O God' (in the scroll of the book it is written of me)."
###### v8
When he said above, "You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings" (these are offered according to the law),
###### v9
then he added, "See, I have come to do your will." He abolishes the first in order to establish the second.
###### v10
And it is by God's will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
###### v11
And every priest stands day after day at his service, offering again and again the same sacrifices that can never take away sins.
###### v12
But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, "he sat down at the right hand of God,"
###### v13
and since then has been waiting "until his enemies would be made a footstool for his feet."
###### v14
For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.
###### v15
And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
###### v16
"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,"
###### v17
he also adds, "I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more."
###### v18
Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
###### v19
Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,
###### v20
by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh),
###### v21
and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
###### v22
let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
###### v23
Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful.
###### v24
And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds,
###### v25
not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
###### v26
For if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
###### v27
but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.
###### v28
Anyone who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy "on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
###### v29
How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace?
###### v30
For we know the one who said, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay." And again, "The Lord will judge his people."
###### v31
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
###### v32
But recall those earlier days when, after you had been enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings,
###### v33
sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and persecution, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.
###### v34
For you had compassion for those who were in prison, and you cheerfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves possessed something better and more lasting.
###### v35
Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great reward.
###### v36
For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.
###### v37
For yet "in a very little while, the one who is coming will come and will not delay;
###### v38
but my righteous one will live by faith. My soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back."
###### v39
But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those who have faith and so are saved.
