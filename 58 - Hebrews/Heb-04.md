###### v1
Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest is still open, let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it.
###### v2
For indeed the good news came to us just as to them; but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened.
###### v3
For we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "As in my anger I swore, 'They shall not enter my rest,'" though his works were finished at the foundation of the world.
###### v4
For in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows, "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works."
###### v5
And again in this place it says, "They shall not enter my rest."
###### v6
Since therefore it remains open for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,
###### v7
again he sets a certain day-- "today"-- saying through David much later, in the words already quoted, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."
###### v8
For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak later about another day.
###### v9
So then, a sabbath rest still remains for the people of God;
###### v10
for those who enter God's rest also cease from their labors as God did from his.
###### v11
Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall through such disobedience as theirs.
###### v12
Indeed, the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
###### v13
And before him no creature is hidden, but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account.
###### v14
Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.
###### v15
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin.
###### v16
Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
