###### v1
Therefore, brothers and sisters, holy partners in a heavenly calling, consider that Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,
###### v2
was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses also "was faithful in all God's house."
###### v3
Yet Jesus is worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
###### v4
(For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)
###### v5
Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken later.
###### v6
Christ, however, was faithful over God's house as a son, and we are his house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope.
###### v7
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear his voice,
###### v8
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, as on the day of testing in the wilderness,
###### v9
where your ancestors put me to the test, though they had seen my works
###### v10
for forty years. Therefore I was angry with that generation, and I said, 'They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways.'
###### v11
As in my anger I swore, 'They will not enter my rest.'"
###### v12
Take care, brothers and sisters, that none of you may have an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.
###### v13
But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called "today," so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
###### v14
For we have become partners of Christ, if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end.
###### v15
As it is said, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."
###### v16
Now who were they who heard and yet were rebellious? Was it not all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?
###### v17
But with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
###### v18
And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who were disobedient?
###### v19
So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
