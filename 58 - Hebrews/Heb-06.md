###### v1
Therefore let us go on toward perfection, leaving behind the basic teaching about Christ, and not laying again the foundation: repentance from dead works and faith toward God,
###### v2
instruction about baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
###### v3
And we will do this, if God permits.
###### v4
For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit,
###### v5
and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,
###### v6
and then have fallen away, since on their own they are crucifying again the Son of God and are holding him up to contempt.
###### v7
Ground that drinks up the rain falling on it repeatedly, and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.
###### v8
But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and on the verge of being cursed; its end is to be burned over.
###### v9
Even though we speak in this way, beloved, we are confident of better things in your case, things that belong to salvation.
###### v10
For God is not unjust; he will not overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.
###### v11
And we want each one of you to show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope to the very end,
###### v12
so that you may not become sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
###### v13
When God made a promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,
###### v14
saying, "I will surely bless you and multiply you."
###### v15
And thus Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise.
###### v16
Human beings, of course, swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute.
###### v17
In the same way, when God desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it by an oath,
###### v18
so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible that God would prove false, we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us.
###### v19
We have this hope, a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain,
###### v20
where Jesus, a forerunner on our behalf, has entered, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
