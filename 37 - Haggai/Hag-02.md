###### v1
In the second year of King Darius, in the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai, saying:
###### v2
Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, and say,
###### v3
Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing?
###### v4
Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the LORD; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the LORD; work, for I am with you, says the LORD of hosts,
###### v5
according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit abides among you; do not fear.
###### v6
For thus says the LORD of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land;
###### v7
and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the LORD of hosts.
###### v8
The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the LORD of hosts.
###### v9
The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts; and in this place I will give prosperity, says the LORD of hosts.
###### v10
On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai, saying:
###### v11
Thus says the LORD of hosts: Ask the priests for a ruling:
###### v12
If one carries consecrated meat in the fold of one's garment, and with the fold touches bread, or stew, or wine, or oil, or any kind of food, does it become holy? The priests answered, "No."
###### v13
Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean?" The priests answered, "Yes, it becomes unclean."
###### v14
Haggai then said, So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, says the LORD; and so with every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.
###### v15
But now, consider what will come to pass from this day on. Before a stone was placed upon a stone in the LORD's temple,
###### v16
how did you fare? When one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were but twenty.
###### v17
I struck you and all the products of your toil with blight and mildew and hail; yet you did not return to me, says the LORD.
###### v18
Consider from this day on, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider:
###### v19
Is there any seed left in the barn? Do the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree still yield nothing? From this day on I will bless you.
###### v20
The word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month:
###### v21
Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I am about to shake the heavens and the earth,
###### v22
and to overthrow the throne of kingdoms; I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, and overthrow the chariots and their riders; and the horses and their riders shall fall, every one by the sword of a comrade.
###### v23
On that day, says the LORD of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel my servant, son of Shealtiel, says the LORD, and make you like a signet ring; for I have chosen you, says the LORD of hosts.
