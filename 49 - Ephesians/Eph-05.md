###### v1
Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children,
###### v2
and live in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
###### v3
But fornication and impurity of any kind, or greed, must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper among saints.
###### v4
Entirely out of place is obscene, silly, and vulgar talk; but instead, let there be thanksgiving.
###### v5
Be sure of this, that no fornicator or impure person, or one who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
###### v6
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes on those who are disobedient.
###### v7
Therefore do not be associated with them.
###### v8
For once you were darkness, but now in the Lord you are light. Live as children of light--
###### v9
for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true.
###### v10
Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.
###### v11
Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.
###### v12
For it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly;
###### v13
but everything exposed by the light becomes visible,
###### v14
for everything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, "Sleeper, awake! Rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
###### v15
Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise,
###### v16
making the most of the time, because the days are evil.
###### v17
So do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
###### v18
Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,
###### v19
as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts,
###### v20
giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
###### v21
Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.
###### v22
Wives, be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord.
###### v23
For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church, the body of which he is the Savior.
###### v24
Just as the church is subject to Christ, so also wives ought to be, in everything, to their husbands.
###### v25
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,
###### v26
in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word,
###### v27
so as to present the church to himself in splendor, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind-- yes, so that she may be holy and without blemish.
###### v28
In the same way, husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
###### v29
For no one ever hates his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, just as Christ does for the church,
###### v30
because we are members of his body.
###### v31
"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
###### v32
This is a great mystery, and I am applying it to Christ and the church.
###### v33
Each of you, however, should love his wife as himself, and a wife should respect her husband.
