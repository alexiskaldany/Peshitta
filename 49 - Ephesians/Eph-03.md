###### v1
This is the reason that I Paul am a prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--
###### v2
for surely you have already heard of the commission of God's grace that was given me for you,
###### v3
and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote above in a few words,
###### v4
a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ.
###### v5
In former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit:
###### v6
that is, the Gentiles have become fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
###### v7
Of this gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God's grace that was given me by the working of his power.
###### v8
Although I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to me to bring to the Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ,
###### v9
and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things;
###### v10
so that through the church the wisdom of God in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.
###### v11
This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,
###### v12
in whom we have access to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him.
###### v13
I pray therefore that you may not lose heart over my sufferings for you; they are your glory.
###### v14
For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
###### v15
from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name.
###### v16
I pray that, according to the riches of his glory, he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his Spirit,
###### v17
and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love.
###### v18
I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
###### v19
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
###### v20
Now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine,
###### v21
to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
