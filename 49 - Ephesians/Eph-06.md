###### v1
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
###### v2
"Honor your father and mother"-- this is the first commandment with a promise:
###### v3
"so that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth."
###### v4
And, fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
###### v5
Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as you obey Christ;
###### v6
not only while being watched, and in order to please them, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.
###### v7
Render service with enthusiasm, as to the Lord and not to men and women,
###### v8
knowing that whatever good we do, we will receive the same again from the Lord, whether we are slaves or free.
###### v9
And, masters, do the same to them. Stop threatening them, for you know that both of you have the same Master in heaven, and with him there is no partiality.
###### v10
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power.
###### v11
Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
###### v12
For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
###### v13
Therefore take up the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to withstand on that evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.
###### v14
Stand therefore, and fasten the belt of truth around your waist, and put on the breastplate of righteousness.
###### v15
As shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to proclaim the gospel of peace.
###### v16
With all of these, take the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
###### v17
Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
###### v18
Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints.
###### v19
Pray also for me, so that when I speak, a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,
###### v20
for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it boldly, as I must speak.
###### v21
So that you also may know how I am and what I am doing, Tychicus will tell you everything. He is a dear brother and a faithful minister in the Lord.
###### v22
I am sending him to you for this very purpose, to let you know how we are, and to encourage your hearts.
###### v23
Peace be to the whole community, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
###### v24
Grace be with all who have an undying love for our Lord Jesus Christ.
