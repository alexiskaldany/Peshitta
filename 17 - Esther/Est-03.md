###### v1
After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the officials who were with him.
###### v2
And all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and did obeisance to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or do obeisance.
###### v3
Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king's command?"
###### v4
When they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai's words would avail; for he had told them that he was a Jew.
###### v5
When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or do obeisance to him, Haman was infuriated.
###### v6
But he thought it beneath him to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, having been told who Mordecai's people were, Haman plotted to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.
###### v7
In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur-- which means "the lot"-- before Haman for the day and for the month, and the lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
###### v8
Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered and separated among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king's laws, so that it is not appropriate for the king to tolerate them.
###### v9
If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued for their destruction, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's business, so that they may put it into the king's treasuries."
###### v10
So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
###### v11
The king said to Haman, "The money is given to you, and the people as well, to do with them as it seems good to you."
###### v12
Then the king's secretaries were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king's satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language; it was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's ring.
###### v13
Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces, giving orders to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.
###### v14
A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation, calling on all the peoples to be ready for that day.
###### v15
The couriers went quickly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.
