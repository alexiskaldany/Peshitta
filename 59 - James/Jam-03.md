###### v1
Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
###### v2
For all of us make many mistakes. Anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect, able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle.
###### v3
If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide their whole bodies.
###### v4
Or look at ships: though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
###### v5
So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great exploits. How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire!
###### v6
And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity; it stains the whole body, sets on fire the cycle of nature, and is itself set on fire by hell.
###### v7
For every species of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species,
###### v8
but no one can tame the tongue-- a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
###### v9
With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God.
###### v10
From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this ought not to be so.
###### v11
Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water?
###### v12
Can a fig tree, my brothers and sisters, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water yield fresbe
###### v13
Who is wise and understanding among you? Show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom.
###### v14
But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be boastful and false to the truth.
###### v15
Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, devilish.
###### v16
For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind.
###### v17
But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy.
###### v18
And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.
