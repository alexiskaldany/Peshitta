###### v1
My brothers and sisters, do you with your acts of favoritism really believe in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ?
###### v2
For if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly, and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in,
###### v3
and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say, "Have a seat here, please," while to the one who is poor you say, "Stand there," or, "Sit at my feet,"
###### v4
have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
###### v5
Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters. Has not God chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?
###### v6
But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court?
###### v7
Is it not they who blaspheme the excellent name that was invoked over you?
###### v8
You do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
###### v9
But if you show partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
###### v10
For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.
###### v11
For the one who said, "You shall not commit adultery," also said, "You shall not murder." Now if you do not commit adultery but if you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
###### v12
So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
###### v13
For judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.
###### v14
What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but do not have works? Can faith save you?
###### v15
If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food,
###### v16
and one of you says to them, "Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill," and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that?
###### v17
So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.
###### v18
But someone will say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith.
###### v19
You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe-- and shudder.
###### v20
Do you want to be shown, you senseless person, that faith apart from works is barren?
###### v21
Was not our ancestor Abraham justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
###### v22
You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was brought to completion by the works.
###### v23
Thus the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness," and he was called the friend of God.
###### v24
You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
###### v25
Likewise, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another road?
###### v26
For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.
