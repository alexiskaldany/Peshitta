# Galatians 6

[[Gal-05|Galatians - Chapter 5]] | [[Galatians]]
***

###### v1
My friends, if anyone is detected in a transgression, you who have received the Spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness. Take care that you yourselves are not tempted.
###### v2
Bear one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
###### v3
For if those who are nothing think they are something, they deceive themselves.
###### v4
All must test their own work; then that work, rather than their neighbor's work, will become a cause for pride.
###### v5
For all must carry their own loads.
###### v6
Those who are taught the word must share in all good things with their teacher.
###### v7
Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for you reap whatever you sow.
###### v8
If you sow to your own flesh, you will reap corruption from the flesh; but if you sow to the Spirit, you will reap eternal life from the Spirit.
###### v9
So let us not grow weary in doing what is right, for we will reap at harvest time, if we do not give up.
###### v10
So then, whenever we have an opportunity, let us work for the good of all, and especially for those of the family of faith.
###### v11
See what large letters I make when I am writing in my own hand!
###### v12
It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcised-- only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
###### v13
Even the circumcised do not themselves obey the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh.
###### v14
May I never boast of anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
###### v15
For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything; but a new creation is everything!
###### v16
As for those who will follow this rule-- peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
###### v17
From now on, let no one make trouble for me; for I carry the marks of Jesus branded on my body.
###### v18
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.
