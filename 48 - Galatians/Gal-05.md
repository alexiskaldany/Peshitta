###### v1
For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.
###### v2
Listen! I, Paul, am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
###### v3
Once again I testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law.
###### v4
You who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.
###### v5
For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.
###### v6
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything; the only thing that counts is faith working through love.
###### v7
You were running well; who prevented you from obeying the truth?
###### v8
Such persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
###### v9
A little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough.
###### v10
I am confident about you in the Lord that you will not think otherwise. But whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty.
###### v11
But my friends, why am I still being persecuted if I am still preaching circumcision? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.
###### v12
I wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves!
###### v13
For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another.
###### v14
For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
###### v15
If, however, you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.
###### v16
Live by the Spirit, I say, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh.
###### v17
For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want.
###### v18
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not subject to the law.
###### v19
Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness,
###### v20
idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions,
###### v21
envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
###### v22
By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness,
###### v23
gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.
###### v24
And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
###### v25
If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.
###### v26
Let us not become conceited, competing against one another, envying one another.
