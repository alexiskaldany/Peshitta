###### v1
I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
###### v2
Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of God-- what is good and acceptable and perfect.
###### v3
For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.
###### v4
For as in one body we have many members, and not all the members have the same function,
###### v5
so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually we are members one of another.
###### v6
We have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us: prophecy, in proportion to faith;
###### v7
ministry, in ministering; the teacher, in teaching;
###### v8
the exhorter, in exhortation; the giver, in generosity; the leader, in diligence; the compassionate, in cheerfulness.
###### v9
Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good;
###### v10
love one another with mutual affection; outdo one another in showing honor.
###### v11
Do not lag in zeal, be ardent in spirit, serve the Lord.
###### v12
Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in prayer.
###### v13
Contribute to the needs of the saints; extend hospitality to strangers.
###### v14
Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.
###### v15
Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.
###### v16
Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly; do not claim to be wiser than you are.
###### v17
Do not repay anyone evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all.
###### v18
If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
###### v19
Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of God; for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."
###### v20
No, "if your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them something to drink; for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads."
###### v21
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
