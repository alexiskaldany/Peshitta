###### v1
I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.
###### v2
God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
###### v3
"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left, and they are seeking my life."
###### v4
But what is the divine reply to him? "I have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
###### v5
So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.
###### v6
But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
###### v7
What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,
###### v8
as it is written, "God gave them a sluggish spirit, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day."
###### v9
And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;
###### v10
let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and keep their backs forever bent."
###### v11
So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their stumbling salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.
###### v12
Now if their stumbling means riches for the world, and if their defeat means riches for Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!
###### v13
Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry
###### v14
in order to make my own people jealous, and thus save some of them.
###### v15
For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead!
###### v16
If the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; and if the root is holy, then the branches also are holy.
###### v17
But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree,
###### v18
do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that it is not you that support the root, but the root that supports you.
###### v19
You will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
###### v20
That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand only through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe.
###### v21
For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you.
###### v22
Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
###### v23
And even those of Israel, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
###### v24
For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree.
###### v25
So that you may not claim to be wiser than you are, brothers and sisters, I want you to understand this mystery: a hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.
###### v26
And so all Israel will be saved; as it is written, "Out of Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob."
###### v27
"And this is my covenant with them, when I take away their sins."
###### v28
As regards the gospel they are enemies of God for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved, for the sake of their ancestors;
###### v29
for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
###### v30
Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience,
###### v31
so they have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy.
###### v32
For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all.
###### v33
O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
###### v34
"For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?"
###### v35
"Or who has given a gift to him, to receive a gift in return?"
###### v36
For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.
