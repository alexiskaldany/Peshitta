***

###### v1
Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge people fairly?
###### v2
No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth.
###### v3
The wicked go astray from the womb; they err from their birth, speaking lies.
###### v4
They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear,
###### v5
so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter.
###### v6
O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD!
###### v7
Let them vanish like water that runs away; like grass let them be trodden down and wither.
###### v8
Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime; like the untimely birth that never sees the sun.
###### v9
Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!
###### v10
The righteous will rejoice when they see vengeance done; they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.
###### v11
People will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth."
