###### v1
O God, do not keep silence; do not hold your peace or be still, O God!
###### v2
Even now your enemies are in tumult; those who hate you have raised their heads.
###### v3
They lay crafty plans against your people; they consult together against those you protect.
###### v4
They say, "Come, let us wipe them out as a nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more."
###### v5
They conspire with one accord; against you they make a covenant--
###### v6
the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,
###### v7
Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
###### v8
Assyria also has joined them; they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah
###### v9
Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the Wadi Kishon,
###### v10
who were destroyed at En-dor, who became dung for the ground.
###### v11
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
###### v12
who said, "Let us take the pastures of God for our own possession."
###### v13
O my God, make them like whirling dust, like chaff before the wind.
###### v14
As fire consumes the forest, as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,
###### v15
so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your hurricane.
###### v16
Fill their faces with shame, so that they may seek your name, O LORD.
###### v17
Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever; let them perish in disgrace.
###### v18
Let them know that you alone, whose name is the LORD, are the Most High over all the earth.
