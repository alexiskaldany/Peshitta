###### v1
The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want.
###### v2
He makes me lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside still waters;
###### v3
he restores my soul. He leads me in right paths for his name's sake.
###### v4
Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I fear no evil; for you are with me; your rod and your staff-- they comfort me.
###### v5
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
###### v6
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD my whole life long.
