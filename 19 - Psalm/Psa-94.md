###### v1
O LORD, you God of vengeance, you God of vengeance, shine forth!
###### v2
Rise up, O judge of the earth; give to the proud what they deserve!
###### v3
O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?
###### v4
They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.
###### v5
They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage.
###### v6
They kill the widow and the stranger, they murder the orphan,
###### v7
and they say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive."
###### v8
Understand, O dullest of the people; fools, when will you be wise?
###### v9
He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?
###### v10
He who disciplines the nations, he who teaches knowledge to humankind, does he not chastise?
###### v11
The LORD knows our thoughts, that they are but an empty breath.
###### v12
Happy are those whom you discipline, O LORD, and whom you teach out of your law,
###### v13
giving them respite from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
###### v14
For the LORD will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage;
###### v15
for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
###### v16
Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers?
###### v17
If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.
###### v18
When I thought, "My foot is slipping," your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up.
###### v19
When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul.
###### v20
Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who contrive mischief by statute?
###### v21
They band together against the life of the righteous, and condemn the innocent to death.
###### v22
But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge.
###### v23
He will repay them for their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out.
