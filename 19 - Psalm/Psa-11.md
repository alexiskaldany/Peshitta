###### v1
In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to me, "Flee like a bird to the mountains;

for look, the wicked bend the bow, they have fitted their arrow to the string, to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart.
###### v3
If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?"
###### v4
The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven. His eyes behold, his gaze examines humankind.
###### v5
The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked, and his soul hates the lover of violence.
###### v6
On the wicked he will rain coals of fire and sulfur; a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.

For the LORD is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.
