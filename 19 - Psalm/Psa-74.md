###### v1
O God, why do you cast us off forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?
###### v2

###### v8

Why do you hold back your hand; why do you keep your hand in your bosom?

Yet God my King is from of old, working salvation in the earth.

Yours is the day, yours also the night; you established the luminaries and the sun.
###### v17
You have fixed all the bounds of the earth; you made summer and winter.
###### v18
Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy scoffs, and an impious people reviles your name.

Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild animals; do not forget the life of your poor forever.

Have regard for your covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the haunts of violence.

Do not let the downtrodden be put to shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.

Rise up, O God, plead your cause; remember how the impious scoff at you all day long.

Do not forget the clamor of your foes, the uproar of your adversaries that goes up continually.
