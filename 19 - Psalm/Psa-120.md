###### v1
In my distress I cry to the LORD, that he may answer me:
###### v2
"Deliver me, O LORD, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue."
###### v3
What shall be given to you? And what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue?
###### v4
A warrior's sharp arrows, with glowing coals of the broom tree!
###### v5
Woe is me, that I am an alien in Meshech, that I must live among the tents of Kedar.
###### v6
Too long have I had my dwelling among those who hate peace.
###### v7
I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
