###### v1
Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.
###### v2
Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and mind.
###### v3
For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in faithfulness to you.
###### v4
I do not sit with the worthless, nor do I consort with hypocrites;
###### v5
I hate the company of evildoers, and will not sit with the wicked.
###### v6
I wash my hands in innocence, and go around your altar, O LORD,
###### v7
singing aloud a song of thanksgiving, and telling all your wondrous deeds.
###### v8
O LORD, I love the house in which you dwell, and the place where your glory abides.
###### v9
Do not sweep me away with sinners, nor my life with the bloodthirsty,
###### v10
those in whose hands are evil devices, and whose right hands are full of bribes.
###### v11
But as for me, I walk in my integrity; redeem me, and be gracious to me.
###### v12
My foot stands on level ground; in the great congregation I will bless the LORD.
