###### v1
We have heard with our ears, O God, our ancestors have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old:
###### v2
you with your own hand drove out the nations, but them you planted; you afflicted the peoples, but them you set free;
###### v3
for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm give them victory; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, for you delighted in them.
###### v4
You are my King and my God; you command victories for Jacob.
###### v5
Through you we push down our foes; through your name we tread down our assailants.
###### v6
For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me.
###### v7
But you have saved us from our foes, and have put to confusion those who hate us.
###### v8
In God we have boasted continually, and we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah
###### v9
Yet you have rejected us and abased us, and have not gone out with our armies.
###### v10
You made us turn back from the foe, and our enemies have gotten spoil.
###### v11
You have made us like sheep for slaughter, and have scattered us among the nations.
###### v12
You have sold your people for a trifle, demanding no high price for them.
###### v13
You have made us the taunt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of those around us.
###### v14
You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.
###### v15
All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face
###### v16
at the words of the taunters and revilers, at the sight of the enemy and the avenger.
###### v17
All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you, or been false to your covenant.
###### v18
Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from your way,
###### v19
yet you have broken us in the haunt of jackals, and covered us with deep darkness.
###### v20
If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread out our hands to a strange god,
###### v21
would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
###### v22
Because of you we are being killed all day long, and accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
###### v23
Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O Lord? Awake, do not cast us off forever!
###### v24
Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our affliction and oppression?
###### v25
For we sink down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.
###### v26
Rise up, come to our help. Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love.
