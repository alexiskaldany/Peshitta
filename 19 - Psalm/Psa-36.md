***

###### v1
Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in their hearts; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
###### v2
For they flatter themselves in their own eyes that their iniquity cannot be found out and hated.
###### v3
The words of their mouths are mischief and deceit; they have ceased to act wisely and do good.
###### v4
They plot mischief while on their beds; they are set on a way that is not good; they do not reject evil.
###### v5
Your steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.
###### v6
Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your judgments are like the great deep; you save humans and animals alike, O LORD.
###### v7
How precious is your steadfast love, O God! All people may take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
###### v8
They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.
###### v9
For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.
###### v10
O continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your salvation to the upright of heart!
###### v11
Do not let the foot of the arrogant tread on me, or the hand of the wicked drive me away.
###### v12
There the evildoers lie prostrate; they are thrust down, unable to rise.
