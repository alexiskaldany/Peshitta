###### v1
Hear a just cause, O LORD; attend to my cry; give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit.
###### v2
From you let my vindication come; let your eyes see the right.
###### v3
If you try my heart, if you visit me by night, if you test me, you will find no wickedness in me; my mouth does not transgress.
###### v4
As for what others do, by the word of your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.
###### v5
My steps have held fast to your paths; my feet have not slipped.
###### v6
I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; incline your ear to me, hear my words.
###### v7
Wondrously show your steadfast love, O savior of those who seek refuge from their adversaries at your right hand.
###### v8
Guard me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings,
###### v9
from the wicked who despoil me, my deadly enemies who surround me.
###### v10
They close their hearts to pity; with their mouths they speak arrogantly.
###### v11
They track me down; now they surround me; they set their eyes to cast me to the ground.
###### v12
They are like a lion eager to tear, like a young lion lurking in ambush.
###### v13
Rise up, O LORD, confront them, overthrow them! By your sword deliver my life from the wicked,
###### v14
from mortals-- by your hand, O LORD-- from mortals whose portion in life is in this world. May their bellies be filled with what you have stored up for them; may their children have more than enough; may they leave something over to their little ones.
###### v15
As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake I shall be satisfied, beholding your likeness.
