***

###### v1
Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD guards the city, the guard keeps watch in vain.
###### v2
It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives sleep to his beloved.
###### v3
Sons are indeed a heritage from the LORD, the fruit of the womb a reward.
###### v4
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons of one's youth.
###### v5
Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.
