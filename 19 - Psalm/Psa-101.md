***

###### v1
I will sing of loyalty and of justice; to you, O LORD, I will sing.
###### v2
I will study the way that is blameless. When shall I attain it? I will walk with integrity of heart within my house;
###### v3
I will not set before my eyes anything that is base. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.
###### v4
Perverseness of heart shall be far from me; I will know nothing of evil.
###### v5
One who secretly slanders a neighbor I will destroy. A haughty look and an arrogant heart I will not tolerate.
###### v6
I will look with favor on the faithful in the land, so that they may live with me; whoever walks in the way that is blameless shall minister to me.
###### v7
No one who practices deceit shall remain in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue in my presence.
###### v8
Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked in the land, cutting off all evildoers from the city of the LORD.
