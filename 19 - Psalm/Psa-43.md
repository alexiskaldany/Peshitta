***

###### v1
Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause against an ungodly people; from those who are deceitful and unjust deliver me!
###### v2
For you are the God in whom I take refuge; why have you cast me off? Why must I walk about mournfully because of the oppression of the enemy?
###### v3
O send out your light and your truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling.
###### v4
Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy; and I will praise you with the harp, O God, my God.
###### v5
Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help and my God.
