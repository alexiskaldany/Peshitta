For the LORD takes pleasure in his people; he adorns the humble with victory.
###### v5
Let the faithful exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their couches.

Let the high praises of God be in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands,
###### v7
to execute vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,

to bind their kings with fetters and their nobles with chains of iron,
###### v9
to execute on them the judgment decreed. This is glory for all his faithful ones. Praise the LORD!
