###### v1
O LORD, my heart is not lifted up, my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.
###### v2
But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like the weaned child that is with me.
###### v3
O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time on and forevermore.
