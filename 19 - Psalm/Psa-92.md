###### v1
It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to your name, O Most High;
###### v2
to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night,
###### v3
to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre.
###### v4
For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy.
###### v5
How great are your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep!
###### v6
The dullard cannot know, the stupid cannot understand this:
###### v7
though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever,
###### v8
but you, O LORD, are on high forever.
###### v9
For your enemies, O LORD, for your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered.
###### v10
But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil.
###### v11
My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.
###### v12
The righteous flourish like the palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
###### v13
They are planted in the house of the LORD; they flourish in the courts of our God.
###### v14
In old age they still produce fruit; they are always green and full of sap,
###### v15
showing that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
