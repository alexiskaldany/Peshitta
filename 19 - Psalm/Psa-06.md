***

###### v1
O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger, or discipline me in your wrath.
###### v2
Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are shaking with terror.
###### v3
My soul also is struck with terror, while you, O LORD-- how long?
###### v4
Turn, O LORD, save my life; deliver me for the sake of your steadfast love.
###### v5
For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who can give you praise?
###### v6
I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.
###### v7
My eyes waste away because of grief; they grow weak because of all my foes.
###### v8
Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.
###### v9
The LORD has heard my supplication; the LORD accepts my prayer.
###### v10
All my enemies shall be ashamed and struck with terror; they shall turn back, and in a moment be put to shame.
