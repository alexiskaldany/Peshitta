***

###### v1
"Often have they attacked me from my youth"-- let Israel now say--
###### v2
"often have they attacked me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me.
###### v3
The plowers plowed on my back; they made their furrows long."
###### v4
The LORD is righteous; he has cut the cords of the wicked.
###### v5
May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned backward.
###### v6
Let them be like the grass on the housetops that withers before it grows up,
###### v7
with which reapers do not fill their hands or binders of sheaves their arms,
###### v8
while those who pass by do not say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you! We bless you in the name of the LORD!"
