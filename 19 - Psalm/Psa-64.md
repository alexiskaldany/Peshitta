# Psalm 64

***

###### v1
Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from the dread enemy.
###### v2
Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the scheming of evildoers,
###### v3
who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows,
###### v4
shooting from ambush at the blameless; they shoot suddenly and without fear.
###### v5
They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares secretly, thinking, "Who can see us?
###### v6
Who can search out our crimes? We have thought out a cunningly conceived plot." For the human heart and mind are deep.
###### v7
But God will shoot his arrow at them; they will be wounded suddenly.
###### v8
Because of their tongue he will bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake with horror.
###### v9
Then everyone will fear; they will tell what God has brought about, and ponder what he has done.
###### v10
Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him. Let all the upright in heart glory.
