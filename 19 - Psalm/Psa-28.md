###### v1
To you, O LORD, I call; my rock, do not refuse to hear me, for if you are silent to me, I shall be like those who go down to the Pit.
###### v2
Hear the voice of my supplication, as I cry to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your most holy sanctuary.
###### v3
Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who are workers of evil, who speak peace with their neighbors, while mischief is in their hearts.
###### v4
Repay them according to their work, and according to the evil of their deeds; repay them according to the work of their hands; render them their due reward.
###### v5
Because they do not regard the works of the LORD, or the work of his hands, he will break them down and build them up no more.
###### v6
Blessed be the LORD, for he has heard the sound of my pleadings.
###### v7
The LORD is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts; so I am helped, and my heart exults, and with my song I give thanks to him.
###### v8
The LORD is the strength of his people; he is the saving refuge of his anointed.

O save your people, and bless your heritage; be their shepherd, and carry them forever.
