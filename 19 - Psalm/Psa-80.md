###### v1
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock! You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth
###### v2
before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh. Stir up your might, and come to save us!
###### v3
Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved.
###### v4
O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?
###### v5
You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in full measure.
###### v6
You make us the scorn of our neighbors; our enemies laugh among themselves.
###### v7
Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved.
###### v8
You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
###### v9
You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land.
###### v10
The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches;
###### v11
it sent out its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the River.
###### v12
Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?
###### v13
The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it.
###### v14
Turn again, O God of hosts; look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine,
###### v15
the stock that your right hand planted.
###### v16
They have burned it with fire, they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your countenance.
###### v17
But let your hand be upon the one at your right hand, the one whom you made strong for yourself.
###### v18
Then we will never turn back from you; give us life, and we will call on your name.
###### v19
Restore us, O LORD God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved.
