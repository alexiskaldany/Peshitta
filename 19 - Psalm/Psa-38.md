###### v1
O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger, or discipline me in your wrath.
###### v2
For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me.
###### v3
There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.
###### v4
For my iniquities have gone over my head; they weigh like a burden too heavy for me.
###### v5
My wounds grow foul and fester because of my foolishness;
###### v6
I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; all day long I go around mourning.
###### v7
For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
###### v8
I am utterly spent and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart.
###### v9
O Lord, all my longing is known to you; my sighing is not hidden from you.
###### v10
My heart throbs, my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes-- it also has gone from me.
###### v11
My friends and companions stand aloof from my affliction, and my neighbors stand far off.
###### v12
Those who seek my life lay their snares; those who seek to hurt me speak of ruin, and meditate treachery all day long.
###### v13
But I am like the deaf, I do not hear; like the mute, who cannot speak.
###### v14
Truly, I am like one who does not hear, and in whose mouth is no retort.
###### v15
But it is for you, O LORD, that I wait; it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer.
###### v16
For I pray, "Only do not let them rejoice over me, those who boast against me when my foot slips."
###### v17
For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever with me.
###### v18
I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.
###### v19
Those who are my foes without cause are mighty, and many are those who hate me wrongfully.
###### v20
Those who render me evil for good are my adversaries because I follow after good.
###### v21
Do not forsake me, O LORD; O my God, do not be far from me;
###### v22
make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
