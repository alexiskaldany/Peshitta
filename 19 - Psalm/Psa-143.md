###### v1
Hear my prayer, O LORD; give ear to my supplications in your faithfulness; answer me in your righteousness.
###### v2
Do not enter into judgment with your servant, for no one living is righteous before you.
###### v3
For the enemy has pursued me, crushing my life to the ground, making me sit in darkness like those long dead.
###### v4
Therefore my spirit faints within me; my heart within me is appalled.
###### v5
I remember the days of old, I think about all your deeds, I meditate on the works of your hands.
###### v6
I stretch out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah
###### v7
Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit.
###### v8
Let me hear of your steadfast love in the morning, for in you I put my trust. Teach me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.
###### v9
Save me, O LORD, from my enemies; I have fled to you for refuge.
###### v10
Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Let your good spirit lead me on a level path.
###### v11
For your name's sake, O LORD, preserve my life. In your righteousness bring me out of trouble.
###### v12
In your steadfast love cut off my enemies, and destroy all my adversaries, for I am your servant.
