###### v1
My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning?
###### v2
O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer; and by night, but find no rest.
###### v3
Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.
###### v4
In you our ancestors trusted; they trusted, and you delivered them.
###### v5
To you they cried, and were saved; in you they trusted, and were not put to shame.
###### v6
But I am a worm, and not human; scorned by others, and despised by the people.
###### v7
All who see me mock at me; they make mouths at me, they shake their heads;
###### v8
"Commit your cause to the LORD; let him deliver-- let him rescue the one in whom he delights!"
###### v9
Yet it was you who took me from the womb; you kept me safe on my mother's breast.
###### v10
On you I was cast from my birth, and since my mother bore me you have been my God.
###### v11
Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.
###### v12
Many bulls encircle me, strong bulls of Bashan surround me;
###### v13
they open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion.
###### v14
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast;
###### v15
my mouth is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; you lay me in the dust of death.
###### v16
For dogs are all around me; a company of evildoers encircles me. My hands and feet have shriveled;
###### v17
I can count all my bones. They stare and gloat over me;
###### v18
they divide my clothes among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots.
###### v19
But you, O LORD, do not be far away! O my help, come quickly to my aid!
###### v20
Deliver my soul from the sword, my life from the power of the dog!
###### v21
Save me from the mouth of the lion! From the horns of the wild oxen you have rescued me.
###### v22
I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:
###### v23
You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him; stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!
###### v24
For he did not despise or abhor the affliction of the afflicted; he did not hide his face from me, but heard when I cried to him.
###### v25
From you comes my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will pay before those who fear him.
###### v26
The poor shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek him shall praise the LORD. May your hearts live forever!
###### v27
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD; and all the families of the nations shall worship before him.
###### v28
For dominion belongs to the LORD, and he rules over the nations.
###### v29
To him, indeed, shall all who sleep in the earth bow down; before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, and I shall live for him.
###### v30
Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord,
###### v31
and proclaim his deliverance to a people yet unborn, saying that he has done it.
