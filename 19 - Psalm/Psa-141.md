***

###### v1
I call upon you, O LORD; come quickly to me; give ear to my voice when I call to you.
###### v2
Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.
###### v3
Set a guard over my mouth, O LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips.
###### v4
Do not turn my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with those who work iniquity; do not let me eat of their delicacies.
###### v5
Let the righteous strike me; let the faithful correct me. Never let the oil of the wicked anoint my head, for my prayer is continually against their wicked deeds.
###### v6
When they are given over to those who shall condemn them, then they shall learn that my words were pleasant.
###### v7
Like a rock that one breaks apart and shatters on the land, so shall their bones be strewn at the mouth of Sheol.
###### v8
But my eyes are turned toward you, O GOD, my Lord; in you I seek refuge; do not leave me defenseless.
###### v9
Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me, and from the snares of evildoers.
###### v10
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I alone escape.
