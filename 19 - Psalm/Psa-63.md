***

###### v1
O God, you are my God, I seek you, my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
###### v2
So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory.
###### v3
Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you.
###### v4
So I will bless you as long as I live; I will lift up my hands and call on your name.
###### v5
My soul is satisfied as with a rich feast, and my mouth praises you with joyful lips
###### v6
when I think of you on my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night;
###### v7
for you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I sing for joy.
###### v8
My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.
###### v9
But those who seek to destroy my life shall go down into the depths of the earth;
###### v10
they shall be given over to the power of the sword, they shall be prey for jackals.
###### v11
But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped.
