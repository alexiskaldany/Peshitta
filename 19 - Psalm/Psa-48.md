###### v1
Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God. His holy mountain,
###### v2
beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King.
###### v3
Within its citadels God has shown himself a sure defense.
###### v4
Then the kings assembled, they came on together.
###### v5
As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic, they took to flight;
###### v6
trembling took hold of them there, pains as of a woman in labor,
###### v7
as when an east wind shatters the ships of Tarshish.
###### v8
As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God, which God establishes forever. Selah
###### v9
We ponder your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple.
###### v10
Your name, O God, like your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with victory.
###### v11
Let Mount Zion be glad, let the towns of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.
###### v12
Walk about Zion, go all around it, count its towers,
###### v13
consider well its ramparts; go through its citadels, that you may tell the next generation
###### v14
that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will be our guide forever.
