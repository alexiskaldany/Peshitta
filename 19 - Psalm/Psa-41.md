###### v1
Happy are those who consider the poor; the LORD delivers them in the day of trouble.
###### v2
The LORD protects them and keeps them alive; they are called happy in the land. You do not give them up to the will of their enemies.
###### v3
The LORD sustains them on their sickbed; in their illness you heal all their infirmities.
###### v4
As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you."
###### v5
My enemies wonder in malice when I will die, and my name perish.
###### v6
And when they come to see me, they utter empty words, while their hearts gather mischief; when they go out, they tell it abroad.
###### v7
All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me.
###### v8
They think that a deadly thing has fastened on me, that I will not rise again from where I lie.
###### v9
Even my bosom friend in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted the heel against me.
###### v10
But you, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them.
###### v11
By this I know that you are pleased with me; because my enemy has not triumphed over me.
###### v12
But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.
###### v13
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
