###### v1
O LORD, God of my salvation, when, at night, I cry out in your presence,
###### v2
let my prayer come before you; incline your ear to my cry.
###### v3
For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.
###### v4
I am counted among those who go down to the Pit; I am like those who have no help,
###### v5
like those forsaken among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, like those whom you remember no more, for they are cut off from your hand.
###### v6
You have put me in the depths of the Pit, in the regions dark and deep.
###### v7
Your wrath lies heavy upon me, and you overwhelm me with all your waves. Selah
###### v8
You have caused my companions to shun me; you have made me a thing of horror to them. I am shut in so that I cannot escape;
###### v9
my eye grows dim through sorrow. Every day I call on you, O LORD; I spread out my hands to you.
###### v10
Do you work wonders for the dead? Do the shades rise up to praise you? Selah
###### v11
Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, or your faithfulness in Abaddon?
###### v12
Are your wonders known in the darkness, or your saving help in the land of forgetfulness?
###### v13
But I, O LORD, cry out to you; in the morning my prayer comes before you.
###### v14
O LORD, why do you cast me off? Why do you hide your face from me?
###### v15
Wretched and close to death from my youth up, I suffer your terrors; I am desperate.
###### v16
Your wrath has swept over me; your dread assaults destroy me.
###### v17
They surround me like a flood all day long; from all sides they close in on me.
###### v18
You have caused friend and neighbor to shun me; my companions are in darkness.
