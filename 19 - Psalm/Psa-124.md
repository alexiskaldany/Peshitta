***

###### v1
If it had not been the LORD who was on our side-- let Israel now say--
###### v2
if it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when our enemies attacked us,
###### v3
then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us;
###### v4
then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us;
###### v5
then over us would have gone the raging waters.
###### v6
Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth.
###### v7
We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped.
###### v8
Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
