###### v1
Give ear to my words, O LORD; give heed to my sighing.
###### v2
Listen to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you I pray.
###### v3
O LORD, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I plead my case to you, and watch.
###### v4
For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil will not sojourn with you.
###### v5
The boastful will not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers.
###### v6
You destroy those who speak lies; the LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful.
###### v7
But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, will enter your house, I will bow down toward your holy temple in awe of you.
###### v8
Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.
###### v9
For there is no truth in their mouths; their hearts are destruction; their throats are open graves; they flatter with their tongues.
###### v10
Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of their many transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you.
###### v11
But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, so that those who love your name may exult in you.
###### v12
For you bless the righteous, O LORD; you cover them with favor as with a shield.
