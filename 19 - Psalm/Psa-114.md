###### v1
When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
###### v2
Judah became God's sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
###### v3
The sea looked and fled; Jordan turned back.
###### v4
The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.
###### v5
Why is it, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?
###### v6
O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs?
###### v7
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
###### v8
who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.
