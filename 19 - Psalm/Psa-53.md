***

###### v1
Fools say in their hearts, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they commit abominable acts; there is no one who does good.
###### v2
God looks down from heaven on humankind to see if there are any who are wise, who seek after God.
###### v3
They have all fallen away, they are all alike perverse; there is no one who does good, no, not one.
###### v4
Have they no knowledge, those evildoers, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God?
###### v5
There they shall be in great terror, in terror such as has not been. For God will scatter the bones of the ungodly; they will be put to shame, for God has rejected them.
###### v6
O that deliverance for Israel would come from Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be glad.
