***

###### v1
How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
###### v2
How long must I bear pain in my soul, and have sorrow in my heart all day long? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
###### v3
Consider and answer me, O LORD my God! Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death,
###### v4
and my enemy will say, "I have prevailed"; my foes will rejoice because I am shaken.
###### v5
But I trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
###### v6
I will sing to the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me.
