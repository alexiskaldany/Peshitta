###### v6
"I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket.
###### v7
In distress you called, and I rescued you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
###### v8
Hear, O my people, while I admonish you; O Israel, if you would but listen to me!

There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god.
###### v10
I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.

O that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!
###### v14
Then I would quickly subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their foes.
###### v15
Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, and their doom would last forever.

I would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."
