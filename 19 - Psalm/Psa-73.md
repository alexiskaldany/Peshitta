###### v1
Truly God is good to the upright, to those who are pure in heart.
###### v2
But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped.
###### v3
For I was envious of the arrogant; I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
###### v4
For they have no pain; their bodies are sound and sleek.
###### v5
They are not in trouble as others are; they are not plagued like other people.
###### v6
Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them like a garment.
###### v7
Their eyes swell out with fatness; their hearts overflow with follies.
###### v8
They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression.
###### v9
They set their mouths against heaven, and their tongues range over the earth.
###### v10
Therefore the people turn and praise them, and find no fault in them.
###### v11
And they say, "How can God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"
###### v12
Such are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches.
###### v13
All in vain I have kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence.
###### v14
For all day long I have been plagued, and am punished every morning.
###### v15
If I had said, "I will talk on in this way," I would have been untrue to the circle of your children.
###### v16
But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task,
###### v17
until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I perceived their end.
###### v18
Truly you set them in slippery places; you make them fall to ruin.
###### v19
How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors!
###### v20
They are like a dream when one awakes; on awaking you despise their phantoms.
###### v21
When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart,
###### v22
I was stupid and ignorant; I was like a brute beast toward you.
###### v23
Nevertheless I am continually with you; you hold my right hand.
###### v24
You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me with honor.
###### v25
Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire other than you.
###### v26
My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
###### v27
Indeed, those who are far from you will perish; you put an end to those who are false to you.
###### v28
But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, to tell of all your works.
