***

###### v1
How very good and pleasant it is when kindred live together in unity!
###### v2
It is like the precious oil on the head, running down upon the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down over the collar of his robes.
###### v3
It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD ordained his blessing, life forevermore.
