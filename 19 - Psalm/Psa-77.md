###### v1
I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, that he may hear me.
###### v2
In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted.
###### v3
I think of God, and I moan; I meditate, and my spirit faints. Selah
###### v4
You keep my eyelids from closing; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
###### v5
I consider the days of old, and remember the years of long ago.
###### v6
I commune with my heart in the night; I meditate and search my spirit:
###### v7
"Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable?
###### v8
Has his steadfast love ceased forever? Are his promises at an end for all time?
###### v9
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?" Selah
###### v10
And I say, "It is my grief that the right hand of the Most High has changed."
###### v11
I will call to mind the deeds of the LORD; I will remember your wonders of old.
###### v12
I will meditate on all your work, and muse on your mighty deeds.
###### v13
Your way, O God, is holy. What god is so great as our God?
###### v14
You are the God who works wonders; you have displayed your might among the peoples.
###### v15
With your strong arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
###### v16
When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; the very deep trembled.
###### v17
The clouds poured out water; the skies thundered; your arrows flashed on every side.
###### v18
The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
###### v19
Your way was through the sea, your path, through the mighty waters; yet your footprints were unseen.
###### v20
You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
