***

###### v1
Why, O LORD, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
###### v2
In arrogance the wicked persecute the poor-- let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.
###### v3
For the wicked boast of the desires of their heart, those greedy for gain curse and renounce the LORD.
###### v4
In the pride of their countenance the wicked say, "God will not seek it out"; all their thoughts are, "There is no God."
###### v5
Their ways prosper at all times; your judgments are on high, out of their sight; as for their foes, they scoff at them.
###### v6
They think in their heart, "We shall not be moved; throughout all generations we shall not meet adversity."
###### v7
Their mouths are filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under their tongues are mischief and iniquity.
###### v8
They sit in ambush in the villages; in hiding places they murder the innocent. Their eyes stealthily watch for the helpless;
###### v9
they lurk in secret like a lion in its covert; they lurk that they may seize the poor; they seize the poor and drag them off in their net.
###### v10
They stoop, they crouch, and the helpless fall by their might.
###### v11
They think in their heart, "God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he will never see it."
###### v12
Rise up, O LORD; O God, lift up your hand; do not forget the oppressed.
###### v13
Why do the wicked renounce God, and say in their hearts, "You will not call us to account"?
###### v14
But you do see! Indeed you note trouble and grief, that you may take it into your hands; the helpless commit themselves to you; you have been the helper of the orphan.
###### v15
Break the arm of the wicked and evildoers; seek out their wickedness until you find none.
###### v16
The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations shall perish from his land.
###### v17
O LORD, you will hear the desire of the meek; you will strengthen their heart, you will incline your ear
###### v18
to do justice for the orphan and the oppressed, so that those from earth may strike terror no more.
