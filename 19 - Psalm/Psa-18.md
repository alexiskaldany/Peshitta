###### v1
I love you, O LORD, my strength.

The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
###### v3
I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, so I shall be saved from my enemies.
###### v4
The cords of death encompassed me; the torrents of perdition assailed me;
###### v5
the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
###### v6
In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.
###### v7
Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.
###### v8
Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.
###### v9
He bowed the heavens, and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.
###### v10
He rode on a cherub, and flew; he came swiftly upon the wings of the wind.
###### v11
He made darkness his covering around him, his canopy thick clouds dark with water.
###### v12
Out of the brightness before him there broke through his clouds hailstones and coals of fire.
###### v13
The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice.
###### v14
And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings, and routed them.
###### v15
Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

He reached down from on high, he took me; he drew me out of mighty waters.
###### v17
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
###### v18
They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was my support.
###### v19
He brought me out into a broad place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
###### v20
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.
###### v21
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
###### v22
For all his ordinances were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.
###### v23
I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from guilt.
###### v24
Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
###### v25
With the loyal you show yourself loyal; with the blameless you show yourself blameless;
###### v26
with the pure you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you show yourself perverse.
###### v27
For you deliver a humble people, but the haughty eyes you bring down.
###### v28
It is you who light my lamp; the LORD, my God, lights up my darkness.
###### v29
By you I can crush a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.
###### v30
This God-- his way is perfect; the promise of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all who take refuge in him.
###### v31
For who is God except the LORD? And who is a rock besides our God?--
###### v32
the God who girded me with strength, and made my way safe.
###### v33
He made my feet like the feet of a deer, and set me secure on the heights.
###### v34
He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.

You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand has supported me; your help has made me great.
###### v36
You gave me a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.
###### v37
I pursued my enemies and overtook them; and did not turn back until they were consumed.
###### v38
I struck them down, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.
###### v39
For you girded me with strength for the battle; you made my assailants sink under me.
###### v40
You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.
###### v41
They cried for help, but there was no one to save them; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.
###### v42
I beat them fine, like dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.
###### v43
You delivered me from strife with the peoples; you made me head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.
###### v44
As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.

Foreigners lost heart, and came trembling out of their strongholds.
###### v46
The LORD lives! Blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation,
###### v47
the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me;
###### v48
who delivered me from my enemies; indeed, you exalted me above my adversaries; you delivered me from the violent.
###### v49
For this I will extol you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to your name.

Great triumphs he gives to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever.
