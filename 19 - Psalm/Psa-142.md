***

###### v1
With my voice I cry to the LORD; with my voice I make supplication to the LORD.
###### v2
I pour out my complaint before him; I tell my trouble before him.
###### v3
When my spirit is faint, you know my way. In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me.
###### v4
Look on my right hand and see-- there is no one who takes notice of me; no refuge remains to me; no one cares for me.
###### v5
I cry to you, O LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."
###### v6
Give heed to my cry, for I am brought very low. Save me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me.
###### v7
Bring me out of prison, so that I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will surround me, for you will deal bountifully with me.
