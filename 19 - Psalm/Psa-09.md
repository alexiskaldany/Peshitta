When my enemies turned back, they stumbled and perished before you.

###### v5
You have rebuked the nations, you have destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name forever and ever.

###### v15
The nations have sunk in the pit that they made; in the net that they hid has their own foot been caught.
