###### v1
For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation.
###### v2
He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall never be shaken.
###### v3
How long will you assail a person, will you batter your victim, all of you, as you would a leaning wall, a tottering fence?
###### v4
Their only plan is to bring down a person of prominence. They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. Selah
###### v5
For God alone my soul waits in silence, for my hope is from him.
###### v6
He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken.
###### v7
On God rests my deliverance and my honor; my mighty rock, my refuge is in God.
###### v8
Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah
###### v9
Those of low estate are but a breath, those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath.
###### v10
Put no confidence in extortion, and set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
###### v11
Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God,
###### v12
and steadfast love belongs to you, O Lord. For you repay to all according to their work.
