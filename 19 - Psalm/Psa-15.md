***

###### v1
O LORD, who may abide in your tent? Who may dwell on your holy hill?
###### v2
Those who walk blamelessly, and do what is right, and speak the truth from their heart;
###### v3
who do not slander with their tongue, and do no evil to their friends, nor take up a reproach against their neighbors;
###### v4
in whose eyes the wicked are despised, but who honor those who fear the LORD; who stand by their oath even to their hurt;
###### v5
who do not lend money at interest, and do not take a bribe against the innocent. Those who do these things shall never be moved.
