###### v1
Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise up against me.
###### v2
Deliver me from those who work evil; from the bloodthirsty save me.
###### v3
Even now they lie in wait for my life; the mighty stir up strife against me. For no transgression or sin of mine, O LORD,
###### v4
for no fault of mine, they run and make ready. Rouse yourself, come to my help and see!
###### v5
You, LORD God of hosts, are God of Israel. Awake to punish all the nations; spare none of those who treacherously plot evil. Selah
###### v6
Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.
###### v7
There they are, bellowing with their mouths, with sharp words on their lips-- for "Who," they think, "will hear us?"
###### v8
But you laugh at them, O LORD; you hold all the nations in derision.
###### v9
O my strength, I will watch for you; for you, O God, are my fortress.
###### v10
My God in his steadfast love will meet me; my God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.
###### v11
Do not kill them, or my people may forget; make them totter by your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.
###### v12
For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter,
###### v13
consume them in wrath; consume them until they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah
###### v14
Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.
###### v15
They roam about for food, and growl if they do not get their fill.
###### v16
But I will sing of your might; I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning. For you have been a fortress for me and a refuge in the day of my distress.
###### v17
O my strength, I will sing praises to you, for you, O God, are my fortress, the God who shows me steadfast love.
