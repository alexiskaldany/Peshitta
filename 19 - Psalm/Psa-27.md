###### v1
The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
###### v2
When evildoers assail me to devour my flesh-- my adversaries and foes-- they shall stumble and fall.
###### v3
Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war rise up against me, yet I will be confident.
###### v4
One thing I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: to live in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.
###### v5
For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will set me high on a rock.
###### v6
Now my head is lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the LORD.
###### v7
Hear, O LORD, when I cry aloud, be gracious to me and answer me!
###### v8
"Come," my heart says, "seek his face!" Your face, LORD, do I seek.
###### v9
Do not hide your face from me. Do not turn your servant away in anger, you who have been my help. Do not cast me off, do not forsake me, O God of my salvation!
###### v10
If my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will take me up.
###### v11
Teach me your way, O LORD, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies.
###### v12
Do not give me up to the will of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen against me, and they are breathing out violence.
###### v13
I believe that I shall see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
###### v14
Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the LORD!
