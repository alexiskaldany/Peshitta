***

###### v1
Be pleased, O God, to deliver me. O LORD, make haste to help me!
###### v2
Let those be put to shame and confusion who seek my life. Let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire to hurt me.
###### v3
Let those who say, "Aha, Aha!" turn back because of their shame.
###### v4
Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation say evermore, "God is great!"
###### v5
But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay!
