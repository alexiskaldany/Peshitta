***

###### v1
Fools say in their hearts, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds; there is no one who does good.
###### v2
The LORD looks down from heaven on humankind to see if there are any who are wise, who seek after God.
###### v3
They have all gone astray, they are all alike perverse; there is no one who does good, no, not one.
###### v4
Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon the LORD?
###### v5
There they shall be in great terror, for God is with the company of the righteous.
###### v6
You would confound the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge.
###### v7
O that deliverance for Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be glad.
