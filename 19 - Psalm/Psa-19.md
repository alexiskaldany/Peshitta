***

###### v1
The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
###### v2
Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night declares knowledge.
###### v3
There is no speech, nor are there words; their voice is not heard;
###### v4
yet their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In the heavens he has set a tent for the sun,
###### v5
which comes out like a bridegroom from his wedding canopy, and like a strong man runs its course with joy.
###### v6
Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them; and nothing is hid from its heat.
###### v7
The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the decrees of the LORD are sure, making wise the simple;
###### v8
the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is clear, enlightening the eyes;
###### v9
the fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
###### v10
More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey, and drippings of the honeycomb.
###### v11
Moreover by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.
###### v12
But who can detect their errors? Clear me from hidden faults.
###### v13
Keep back your servant also from the insolent; do not let them have dominion over me. Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression.
###### v14
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable to you, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
