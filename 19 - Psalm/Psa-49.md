###### v1
Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
###### v2
both low and high, rich and poor together.
###### v3
My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.
###### v4
I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the harp.
###### v5
Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of my persecutors surrounds me,
###### v6
those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?
###### v7
Truly, no ransom avails for one's life, there is no price one can give to God for it.
###### v8
For the ransom of life is costly, and can never suffice
###### v9
that one should live on forever and never see the grave.
###### v10
When we look at the wise, they die; fool and dolt perish together and leave their wealth to others.
###### v11
Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they named lands their own.
###### v12
Mortals cannot abide in their pomp; they are like the animals that perish.
###### v13
Such is the fate of the foolhardy, the end of those who are pleased with their lot. Selah
###### v14
Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; straight to the grave they descend, and their form shall waste away; Sheol shall be their home.
###### v15
But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah
###### v16
Do not be afraid when some become rich, when the wealth of their houses increases.
###### v17
For when they die they will carry nothing away; their wealth will not go down after them.
###### v18
Though in their lifetime they count themselves happy-- for you are praised when you do well for yourself--
###### v19
they will go to the company of their ancestors, who will never again see the light.
###### v20
Mortals cannot abide in their pomp; they are like the animals that perish.
