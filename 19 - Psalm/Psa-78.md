###### v1
Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
###### v2
I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old,
###### v3
things that we have heard and known, that our ancestors have told us.
###### v4
We will not hide them from their children; we will tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, and the wonders that he has done.
###### v5
He established a decree in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach to their children;
###### v6
that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and rise up and tell them to their children,
###### v7
so that they should set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;
###### v8
and that they should not be like their ancestors, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God.
###### v9
The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle.
###### v10
They did not keep God's covenant, but refused to walk according to his law.
###### v11
They forgot what he had done, and the miracles that he had shown them.
###### v12
In the sight of their ancestors he worked marvels in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.
###### v13
He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap.
###### v14
In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all night long with a fiery light.
###### v15
He split rocks open in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.
###### v16
He made streams come out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down like rivers.
###### v17
Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
###### v18
They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved.
###### v19
They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?
###### v20
Even though he struck the rock so that water gushed out and torrents overflowed, can he also give bread, or provide meat for his people?"
###### v21
Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of rage; a fire was kindled against Jacob, his anger mounted against Israel,
###### v22
because they had no faith in God, and did not trust his saving power.
###### v23
Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;
###### v24
he rained down on them manna to eat, and gave them the grain of heaven.
###### v25
Mortals ate of the bread of angels; he sent them food in abundance.
###### v26
He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;
###### v27
he rained flesh upon them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;
###### v28
he let them fall within their camp, all around their dwellings.
###### v29
And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.
###### v30
But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,
###### v31
the anger of God rose against them and he killed the strongest of them, and laid low the flower of Israel.
###### v32
In spite of all this they still sinned; they did not believe in his wonders.
###### v33
So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.
###### v34
When he killed them, they sought for him; they repented and sought God earnestly.
###### v35
They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.
###### v36
But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.
###### v37
Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not true to his covenant.
###### v38
Yet he, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; often he restrained his anger, and did not stir up all his wrath.
###### v39
He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and does not come again.
###### v40
How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!
###### v41
They tested God again and again, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
###### v42
They did not keep in mind his power, or the day when he redeemed them from the foe;
###### v43
when he displayed his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the fields of Zoan.
###### v44
He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.
###### v45
He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.
###### v46
He gave their crops to the caterpillar, and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
###### v47
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.
###### v48
He gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.
###### v49
He let loose on them his fierce anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.
###### v50
He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.
###### v51
He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first issue of their strength in the tents of Ham.
###### v52
Then he led out his people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
###### v53
He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
###### v54
And he brought them to his holy hill, to the mountain that his right hand had won.
###### v55
He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
###### v56
Yet they tested the Most High God, and rebelled against him. They did not observe his decrees,
###### v57
but turned away and were faithless like their ancestors; they twisted like a treacherous bow.
###### v58
For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.
###### v59
When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.
###### v60
He abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mortals,
###### v61
and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.
###### v62
He gave his people to the sword, and vented his wrath on his heritage.
###### v63
Fire devoured their young men, and their girls had no marriage song.
###### v64
Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.
###### v65
Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a warrior shouting because of wine.
###### v66
He put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting disgrace.
###### v67
He rejected the tent of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
###### v68
but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.
###### v69
He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever.
###### v70
He chose his servant David, and took him from the sheepfolds;
###### v71
from tending the nursing ewes he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel, his inheritance.
###### v72
With upright heart he tended them, and guided them with skillful hand.
