###### v1
As a deer longs for flowing streams, so my soul longs for you, O God.
###### v2
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?
###### v3
My tears have been my food day and night, while people say to me continually, "Where is your God?"
###### v4
These things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I went with the throng, and led them in procession to the house of God, with glad shouts and songs of thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.
###### v5
Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help
###### v6
and my God. My soul is cast down within me; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
###### v7
Deep calls to deep at the thunder of your cataracts; all your waves and your billows have gone over me.
###### v8
By day the LORD commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.
###### v9
I say to God, my rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I walk about mournfully because the enemy oppresses me?"
###### v10
As with a deadly wound in my body, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me continually, "Where is your God?"
###### v11
Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help and my God.
