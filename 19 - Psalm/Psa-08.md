***

###### v1
O LORD, our Sovereign, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.
###### v2
Out of the mouths of babes and infants you have founded a bulwark because of your foes, to silence the enemy and the avenger.
###### v3
When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have established;
###### v4
what are human beings that you are mindful of them, mortals that you care for them?
###### v5
Yet you have made them a little lower than God, and crowned them with glory and honor.
###### v6
You have given them dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under their feet,
###### v7
all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field,
###### v8
the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas.
###### v9
O LORD, our Sovereign, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
