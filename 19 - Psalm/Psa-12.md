###### v1
Help, O LORD, for there is no longer anyone who is godly; the faithful have disappeared from humankind.
###### v2
They utter lies to each other; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
###### v3
May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,
###### v4
those who say, "With our tongues we will prevail; our lips are our own-- who is our master?"
###### v5
"Because the poor are despoiled, because the needy groan, I will now rise up," says the LORD; "I will place them in the safety for which they long."
###### v6
The promises of the LORD are promises that are pure, silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.
###### v7
You, O LORD, will protect us; you will guard us from this generation forever.
###### v8
On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among humankind.
