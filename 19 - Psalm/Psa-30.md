***

###### v1
I will extol you, O LORD, for you have drawn me up, and did not let my foes rejoice over me.
###### v2
O LORD my God, I cried to you for help, and you have healed me.
###### v3
O LORD, you brought up my soul from Sheol, restored me to life from among those gone down to the Pit.
###### v4
Sing praises to the LORD, O you his faithful ones, and give thanks to his holy name.
###### v5
For his anger is but for a moment; his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may linger for the night, but joy comes with the morning.
###### v6
As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved."
###### v7
By your favor, O LORD, you had established me as a strong mountain; you hid your face; I was dismayed.
###### v8
To you, O LORD, I cried, and to the LORD I made supplication:
###### v9
"What profit is there in my death, if I go down to the Pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness?
###### v10
Hear, O LORD, and be gracious to me! O LORD, be my helper!"
###### v11
You have turned my mourning into dancing; you have taken off my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,
###### v12
so that my soul may praise you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever.
