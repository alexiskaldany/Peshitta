###### v1
Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.
###### v2
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
###### v3
For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
###### v4
Against you, you alone, have I sinned, and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are justified in your sentence and blameless when you pass judgment.
###### v5
Indeed, I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me.
###### v6
You desire truth in the inward being; therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.
###### v7
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
###### v8
Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have crushed rejoice.
###### v9
Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
###### v10
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.
###### v11
Do not cast me away from your presence, and do not take your holy spirit from me.
###### v12
Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and sustain in me a willing spirit.
###### v13
Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.
###### v14
Deliver me from bloodshed, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your deliverance.
###### v15
O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.
###### v16
For you have no delight in sacrifice; if I were to give a burnt offering, you would not be pleased.
###### v17
The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
###### v18
Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,
###### v19
then you will delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.
