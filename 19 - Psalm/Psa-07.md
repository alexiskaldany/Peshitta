###### v1
O LORD my God, in you I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me,
###### v2
or like a lion they will tear me apart; they will drag me away, with no one to rescue.
###### v3
O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,
###### v4
if I have repaid my ally with harm or plundered my foe without cause,
###### v5
then let the enemy pursue and overtake me, trample my life to the ground, and lay my soul in the dust. Selah
###### v6
Rise up, O LORD, in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; awake, O my God; you have appointed a judgment.
###### v7
Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered around you, and over it take your seat on high.
###### v8
The LORD judges the peoples; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me.
###### v9
O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous, you who test the minds and hearts, O righteous God.
###### v10
God is my shield, who saves the upright in heart.
###### v11
God is a righteous judge, and a God who has indignation every day.
###### v12
If one does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and strung his bow;
###### v13
he has prepared his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts.
###### v14
See how they conceive evil, and are pregnant with mischief, and bring forth lies.
###### v15
They make a pit, digging it out, and fall into the hole that they have made.
###### v16
Their mischief returns upon their own heads, and on their own heads their violence descends.
###### v17
I will give to the LORD the thanks due to his righteousness, and sing praise to the name of the LORD, the Most High.
