# Psalm 1

[[Psalm]] | [[Psa-02|Psalm - Chapter 2 ]]
***

###### v1
Happy are those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or take the path that sinners tread, or sit in the seat of scoffers;
###### v2
but their delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law they meditate day and night.
###### v3
They are like trees planted by streams of water, which yield their fruit in its season, and their leaves do not wither. In all that they do, they prosper.
###### v4
The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
###### v5
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
###### v6
for the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
