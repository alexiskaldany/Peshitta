***

###### v1
Be gracious to me, O God, for people trample on me; all day long foes oppress me;
###### v2
my enemies trample on me all day long, for many fight against me. O Most High,
###### v3
when I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
###### v4
In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I am not afraid; what can flesh do to me?
###### v5
All day long they seek to injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
###### v6
They stir up strife, they lurk, they watch my steps. As they hoped to have my life,
###### v7
so repay them for their crime; in wrath cast down the peoples, O God!
###### v8
You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your record?
###### v9
Then my enemies will retreat in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me.
###### v10
In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,
###### v11
in God I trust; I am not afraid. What can a mere mortal do to me?
###### v12
My vows to you I must perform, O God; I will render thank offerings to you.
###### v13
For you have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling, so that I may walk before God in the light of life.
