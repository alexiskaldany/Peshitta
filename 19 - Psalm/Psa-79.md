###### v1
O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
###### v2
They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the air for food, the flesh of your faithful to the wild animals of the earth.
###### v3
They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.
###### v4
We have become a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those around us.
###### v5
How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealous wrath burn like fire?
###### v6
Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
###### v7
For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation.
###### v8
Do not remember against us the iniquities of our ancestors; let your compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low.
###### v9
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.
###### v10
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes.
###### v11
Let the groans of the prisoners come before you; according to your great power preserve those doomed to die.
###### v12
Return sevenfold into the bosom of our neighbors the taunts with which they taunted you, O Lord!
###### v13
Then we your people, the flock of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.
