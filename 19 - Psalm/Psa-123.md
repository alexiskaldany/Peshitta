***

###### v1
To you I lift up my eyes, O you who are enthroned in the heavens!
###### v2
As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, until he has mercy upon us.
###### v3
Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us, for we have had more than enough of contempt.
###### v4
Our soul has had more than its fill of the scorn of those who are at ease, of the contempt of the proud.
