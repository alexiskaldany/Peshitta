###### v1
My heart overflows with a goodly theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.
###### v2
You are the most handsome of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever.
###### v3
Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your glory and majesty.
###### v4
In your majesty ride on victoriously for the cause of truth and to defend the right; let your right hand teach you dread deeds.
###### v5
Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; the peoples fall under you.
###### v6
Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever. Your royal scepter is a scepter of equity;
###### v7
you love righteousness and hate wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions;
###### v8
your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad;
###### v9
daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
###### v10
Hear, O daughter, consider and incline your ear; forget your people and your father's house,
###### v11
and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him;
###### v12
the people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts, the richest of the people
###### v13
with all kinds of wealth. The princess is decked in her chamber with gold-woven robes;
###### v14
in many-colored robes she is led to the king; behind her the virgins, her companions, follow.
###### v15
With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king.
###### v16
In the place of ancestors you, O king, shall have sons; you will make them princes in all the earth.
###### v17
I will cause your name to be celebrated in all generations; therefore the peoples will praise you forever and ever.
