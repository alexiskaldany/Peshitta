###### v1
O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; now restore us!
###### v2
You have caused the land to quake; you have torn it open; repair the cracks in it, for it is tottering.
###### v3
You have made your people suffer hard things; you have given us wine to drink that made us reel.
###### v4
You have set up a banner for those who fear you, to rally to it out of bowshot. Selah
###### v5
Give victory with your right hand, and answer us, so that those whom you love may be rescued.
###### v6
God has promised in his sanctuary: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the Vale of Succoth.
###### v7
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter.
###### v8
Moab is my washbasin; on Edom I hurl my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph."
###### v9
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
###### v10
Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go out, O God, with our armies.

O grant us help against the foe, for human help is worthless.

With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
