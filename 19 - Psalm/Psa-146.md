###### v1
Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul!
###### v2
I will praise the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praises to my God all my life long.
###### v3
Do not put your trust in princes, in mortals, in whom there is no help.
###### v4
When their breath departs, they return to the earth; on that very day their plans perish.
###### v5
Happy are those whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD their God,
###### v6
who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps faith forever;
###### v7
who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free;
###### v8
the LORD opens the eyes of the blind. The LORD lifts up those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous.
###### v9
The LORD watches over the strangers; he upholds the orphan and the widow, but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin.
###### v10
The LORD will reign forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise the LORD!
