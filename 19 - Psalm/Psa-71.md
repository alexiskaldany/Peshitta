Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.
###### v5
For you, O Lord, are my hope, my trust, O LORD, from my youth.

I have been like a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge.

O God, from my youth you have taught me, and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.

and your righteousness, O God, reach the high heavens. You who have done great things, O God, who is like you?

You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again; from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.
###### v21
You will increase my honor, and comfort me once again.

I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
###### v23
My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to you; my soul also, which you have rescued.
###### v24
All day long my tongue will talk of your righteous help, for those who tried to do me harm have been put to shame, and disgraced.
